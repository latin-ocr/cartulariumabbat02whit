Meaux was a Cistercian House founded by William le Gros
Earl of Albemarle in 1150, at a place called Melsa6 or Meaux in
Holderness‚ three or four miles to the east of Beverley. Adam,
a monk of Fountains, was the first Amat—(Introduction.)

Praedictus autem Adam, Abbas noster primus, ut dicitur,
aliquando fuit monachus de Whytby, et unus illorum qui

Leigier, quoted by Dodsworth). In the same place, William, the son of the
aforesaid Robert de Percy, confirms his father's confirmation, which again
is confirmed by his, William's, son Robert. This is worthy of note, as it
establishes the first four descents.

1 William de Percy, son of Robert de Percy3 concerning the church of
Bolton Percy (Mon. ii. 35). His seal is mentioned in Dodsworth (viii. 198)
as round: “in medio a Lion Passant Guardant to the Sinister:—SIG1LLVM
WILL’I DE PERCI.’' See the preceding note.

2 A Pichot de Perci is witness to No. 59, a charter by Alan de Percy 16
Meschin, son of the Alan de Perey whose charters were witnessed by the
elder Picot. He is found also among the witnesses to two charters by Henry
de Puteaco (Finchale‚ 23, 24), who is himself, together with this Picot, a
witness to the charter of confirmation of Bolton Church by William de Percy
fitz Robert just noticed :—“ Will. de Perci, fil. Rodberti de Perci . . . con-
cessi et hac m. c. conf. Deo et 6661. S. Oswaldi de N osten, etc„ 6661. (16
Booltona . . . quam Picotus avus meus eis dedit, et Rodbertus pater meus
confirmavit, etc. T. Henrico de Pusat. Petro Basset . . . Willelmo filio
Herveii. Radulpho de Insula . . . Picoto de Perci, ete.’'—(Dugdale, vi. 93.)
Piehot de Percy also attests some of Bishop Pudsey’s (1153-95) charters.

3 Robert de Percy, the Justic. ltin„ had warren at Sutton 15 Joh. (1212'42)
and was living 10 Henr. ΙΙΙ. (1223).

4 Petrus de Percy “dudum defunctu& 51 Henr. 111. (126-7‘2). He was
Sheriff of Yorkshire 1263: and held Samon-(Testa de Nevill.) “Piers
Percy, d’or ung fece engrele d’azur.'’—(Glover⁷s Roll.) His relationship to
his predecessor in possession can only be guessed at.

5 “Robertus de Percy est proximus ejus haeres et . . . Dunstani A0 r.

Regis Henrici quinquagesimo (1265) fuit aet. xxi annorum.” This same
Robart, son and heir of Peter, was acting for his father, 126}.—(Pipe Roll.)
