we have this Symon's son Peter, and. his sister Margaret, who is described as
Symon's heir-apparent—the male line therefore closing in him—uniting in a
certain quitclaim. The suecession, with one break, would then appear to
be fairly clear z—l. Willelmus de Percy, Ohtlesgernuns. 2. Ricardus de

It should, however, be noted here that Charlton (IVlez'thy, p. 227), re-
ferring to the claim he supposes to have been made by Peter de Mauley
111. to certain portions of the Whitby territory, a matter which will be
dealt with at a subsequent page (see Nos. 444446, No. 592, and notes),
says:—“From the rolls that are yet preserved relating to this trial
we learn . . . that between the years 1230 and 1283 there were four
of the name of Percy who lived at Dunsley, and successively possessed the
same, viz.‚ William de Percy, who was living anno 1230, and was suc-
ceeded by Riehard, after whom came Alan, and Alan was succeeded by
William de Percy, who was living anno 1283.” Unluckily all the rolls here
referred 10, save the one printed below (No. 592, already named) have en—
tirely disappeared, and it is impossible to test Charlton's accuracy, as any one
with experience of his statements must be necessarily impelled to (10. But
it will be seen that his first William tallies well with No. VI. in the above
descent3 that his Richard agrees with No. VII. 3 but that there is scanty
room for Alan between vn. and V111., especially if v111. was lord in 1283.
111 1116 absence of witnesses’ names, it is not possible to decide with certainty
which of the three Richards de Percy de Dunsley the grantor of the present
confirmation, or of No. 434, really is.
