Summa v s.

fectly explains as ‘a farm-yard‚' giving Y 011-3]ιὶνο as its local habitation.
In the Oleveland Glossccry it is defined as “ the site on which a house stands,
or has formerly stood.'' This is correctas far as it goes: but it should be
understood as limited to the site of a house of sufficiently ancient (1313 10
carry with it what are called common rights ; in other words, the burden of
the ‘ cum pertinenciis ’ of such perpetual occurrence in ancient charters. It
will be observed that in the text it is made synonymous with tofta—i fronte
sive toftum‚-—and the toft was simply and specially the site of a house,
carrying with it, whether ‘aedificatum’ or 611011331111103111111,’311 the rights,
privileges, easementS, etc., implied in the phrase ‘cum pertinenciis) My
attention was first drawn to the word more than thirty years ago by an old
official of the Manor here, who told me of a ‘ frontstead' on what is now the
common or unenclosed moor 3 and 011 my mentioning it to the late Lord of
the Manor, he directed that a note should be made of it as of an important
fact. In one respect—that is, as regarded in connection with the ancient
history of the district—it has proved an interesting fact. In a fine of 1242
between the Prior of Gyseburne and the regnant Peter de Brus, a lamala is
named as situate in the Park of Danby at 3 part called Souresby. This
name still exist-,s in the form Sowerby, and the locality is distinguished by
the remains of the old 311010311133, and. also by what explains the fact of
there being a zauncla there-namely, the evident indicia of ancient iron-
working on the spot. Doubtless one of the five small foryz'oe named in Inq.
p. m. P. de Brus 111, and described as of little value owing to the destruction
of the forest——cut down and used up in the past smelting operations—had
been located there.
