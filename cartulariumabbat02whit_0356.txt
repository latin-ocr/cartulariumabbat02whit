Elen, or Sibilla. ‘ Henry his eldest sonne’ is right. The names that
follow are, however, in different order from those in the lists given by Dug-

and in the same order. ‘William Lord of Dunsle’ is, of course, a strange
mistake. He was ‘ eanonicus Ebor.' Dugdale also falls into the same error,
overlooking (or not being acquainted with) the fact that the Percys of
Dunsley were by this time as distinct from the main stem as the Pereys of
Kildale. In the same way also at p. 271 he makes Robert de Percy, who
gave the Chureh of Sutton on Derwent to Whitby, a younger brother of
Richard‚ the eldest 5011 of J oceline and Agnes de Perey 3 the fact being, as
is seen from Nos. 43 and 67, that the said Robert (16 Perey is the son of
Picot de Perey, and very many years earlier than a son of Agnes de Percy
could be. In fact, Pichot de Perei 15 6 cotemporary of Alan de Perey (see
No. 28, note 1, p. 60), and his son Robert in the same generation with
William de Percy, father of Agnes and grandfather of Dugdale’s Robert.

founded by Henry de Percy, son of the Lady in question, for the 50111 of his
mother, and his ancestors, 65 mentioned immediately below.
