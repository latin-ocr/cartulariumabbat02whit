OARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 709

egressi sunt de monasterio de Whytby ad monasterium Beatae
Mariae inchoandum1 (i. p. 74).

1 This statement is one of great interest, and, provided only it might be
fully depended upon, suggestive of an explanation where an explanation is
greatly needed. The difficulties involved in the narrative 01 Stephen’s
connection with Whitby, and 01 the severance of such connection, are dealt
with in the Introductory Chapters, pp. lxv-lxxiii, and an attempt was there
made to account for the so-styled “ secession” of Stephen 01 Whitby on the
ground 01 the disappointment and discontent likely to ensue on the appoint-
ment 01 Serlo de Percy to the Priorate which his ambition had led him to
aspire to for himself. The attempt in question depended on a surmise,
probably in itself a by no means unlikely one ς but still the foundation was
but a surmise, a guess, and no more, whatever amount 01 verisimilitude may
be, or may have been, held to belong to it. If the language in the text has
any precise and definite meaning, and is to be regarded as having that
meaning, we have before us a very definite statement indeed. Oertain monks
01 Whitby, 01 whom Adam, subsequently the first Abbot of Melsa, was one,
went out from Whitby with the distinct and definite object in view 01
initiating the Abbey 01 S. Mary at York-—“ad Monasterium B. Mariae
inchoandum.'' The question, of course, is—May we accept that statement
as frankly as it is made? But it is a question more easily asked than
answered—at least, conclusively. One consideration in seeking for such
answer is that obviously the writer could have no very apparent motive for
misrepresenting an historical fact such as this purports to be. The connec-
tion between the two Houses of Whitby and Melsa does not appear to have
been a very close one, and for all trace to the contrary seems to have led to
little beyond the merest business relations in a matter 01 no great com-
plexity or importance 3 at all events, until such time as the non-payment of
its obligations by the Melsa House led to the steps usually adopted in such
cases ; and even then, though the House 01 Whitby seems to have behaved
with liberality, there was nothing to indicate any connection 01 either past
or present interest or affection as existing between the two Houses or their
inmates, So far as we can see, the Chronicler had no motive either to
“ extenuate or aught in malice to set down ;'' and so far as this considera-
tion goes there is nothing to lead on to the rejection of the statement as
inaccurate, or even to raise the question as to its possible inaccuracy.
Another consideration is that there is nothing in the statement that is
inconsistent, and, far more, irreconcileable with the statement made by
Symeon of Durham on the same subject. His words are :—“ Reinfridus ad
Streoneshalch, quod Hwitebi appellatur, secessit, ubi advenientes suscipiens
monachorum habitationem instituere coepit, qui post ejus obitum migrantes
Eboracum, Monasterium in honorem S. Mariae . . ., quod nunc Abbas
Stephanus strenue regit, construxerunt.'’ Now as it would be quite idle to
suppose that Symeon intended to state, or even to imply, that the monks in
a body left Whitby—that the Church or Monastery there was entirely
deserted—the only inference possible besides is that which is put into the
