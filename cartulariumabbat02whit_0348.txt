684 CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

sorore sua. Et praedicta Agnes fuit desponsata cuidam militi
Curiae Domini Regis, dioto Gooelino Lovayn, fratri Ducis Bra-
bantiae. De qua genuit Henrioum, et Ricardum fratrem suum.
Qui quidem Ricardus‚ quia vir animosus erat, intravit in pur-
partiam matris 51116, vivente matre sua, sine aliquo jure haeredi-

him, and was probably a widow‚ and the mother of Evera-rd de Ros, when
he married her. He founded the Abbey of Sallay in 1147.

2. Alan de Percy, le Meschin. Possibly “ Alanus de Percy, magni Alani
filius nothus‚'' who was present at the battle of the Standard.

3. Walter de Percy, de Rugemond. A son of his, named Robert, is met
with 111 No. 60.

4, Geoffrey or Gosfridus.

5. Geoffrey, or Gosfridus, styled the olerk (Clericus), eventually Abbot of
St. Mary's, York. As both he and his brother Geoffrey are living at the
same time—their names are appended to the same oharter (No. 57) in one
case at least—the presumption is that one of them was illegitimate—most
likely this churohman.

6. Henry de Percy.

7. Robert de Percy, whose son John is named.

IV. l. Alan de Percy, died, sine prole, durante vita patris.

2. Matilda de Percy, sister and co-heir of Alan de Percy. Married the
Earl of Warwiek, and died, sp„ about 1204. Buried at Fountains.

3. Agnes de Percy, sister and eo-heir of Alan. Married Jooeline de
Louvaine, brother of Adelicia, Queen of Henry 1., and youngest son of
Godstey, Duke of Brabant and Count of Louvaine.

4. Adelidis de Percy. It is at least open 130 question if there were not a
third sister and co-heir, mother of Henry de Puteaco, or Puisat, or Pudsey,
by the bishop of that name. He grants to Sallay, “pro salute animae meae
et Adelidis de Perci matris meae, et Dionisiae sponsae meae‚'' all Stoekedale,
“sicut in cartis Ricardi de Morevifle et Willelmi de Perci plenius conti-
netur.'' He also had the manor of Perci in Normanby, which, with his
rights in Stoekedale, must have come to him through 1115 mother.

V. l. Henry de Percy. Held his father‘s honour of Petworth 6 Rio. Ι.
Η6 married Isabella, daughter of Adam de Brus, Lord of Skelton, with whom
116 had the vill of Kirk Levington in liberum maritagium.

2. Richard de Percy, described in the Dodsworth genealogy as “filius et
haeres.” Still the desoent and the estates passed on through his brother
Henry's descendants, Richard de Percy is said to have married (1) a daughter
and co-heir of William de Braose; (2) Agnes de Neville, who in 1252 had
remarried to John de Eyneourt.

3. Walter de Percy, presumably. He had a share in the Countess of VVar-
wiok’s goods (Pipe Roll, Ebor. 13 Joh.).

Besides these, Dugdale notes :—

4. Robert (16 Percy.

5⁷ Josceline (16 Percy.
