1 It would appear that some word must be omitted before “vel''—pos-
sibly “ clausam.⁷'

2 The reading here 15 1101 perfectly certain so far as the second word is
concerned, but there 000 100 little doubt that the reading in the text is
correct. The connection is quite clear: the “ raimblis et rislecis '’ are to be
used in making a temporary fence of enclosure for the protection of the
‘campi' during the period of growth, ripening, and harvesting of the corn
sown therein. The word ‘ raimblis ’ (which 15 found also in the deed below,
numbered 507) is beyond doubt identical with ‘ ramell' in Halliwell’s
word “ ramelZ-woocl —natural copse-wood‚” the example to which (from Cott.
MS. Calig. B. vii.) makes it clear that such wood as 15 intended was of suffi-
cient dimensions 10 110 used “for the buyldinge of small houses.⁷⁷ The

raimblis ' then would furnish the hedge stakes (or ‘stowers‚' in local terni)
requisite for forming the fence, and presumably the ‘rislecis,’ which, like
‘ raimblis‚’ is a plural form, the brushwood for wattling or intertwining with
and between the stakes. Ι connect it, though I am not acquainted with any
still existing form of the words, with the old word ‘rise’=twig‚ small
branch, brushwood, from which, it may be observed, the local name Rise-
warp (now Ruswarp), which occurs several times in this deed, takes its first
clement. Probably ‘rislic’ or ‘risloc' is simply a diminutive from ‘rise‚’
through an intermediate ‘riseL'
