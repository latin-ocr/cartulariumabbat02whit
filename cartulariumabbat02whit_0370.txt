To revert to William de Percy, No. 2 in Generation VI. :—
VI. By his wife J ohanna he had a son who may be ranged
conveniently as

VIIb. 1. Alexander de Percy ;2 and a daughter,

have special bequests issuing from his lands in Battersby and Ormesby,
besides the residue of his estate.

1 See last note. The ‘ Descent’ 111 the Percy Feodary brings in here a
John de Percy, son of John de Percy, son of John and Elizabeth (the latter
the lady of the will of 1438), and attributes to him the parentage of four
daughters, viz., “ Isabell Percy, -Joane marr. to Will. Bulmer, Gent.‚ Alice
marr. to Mr. Watson, and Elizabeth Percy‚’' and adds “ these 4 daughters and
co-heires graunted and sould to Henrie Lo. Percy, Erle of Northumberland,
and to his heires the manr of Kildale with the appurtenaunces, and all there
landes and tenements in Kildale or elsewhere 111 the County of York, by
there severall dedes dated in the severall yeres of Henry vn„ viz„ the ἰχῶ,
xviith and xviiith yeres, as by a Booke of his Lo. Euidences may appeare.''
Upon this it may be remarked that it is scarcely to be regarded as incon-
sistent with the will of John de Percy de Kildale dated in 1501. As in
some former instances, the heir “ in feudo et haereditate” may not be named
at all, and besides the two sons who are named, Peter and James, it is by
no means impossible, or even improbable, that there may have been an
elder son John with issue four daughters only. This is a mere conjecture,
but it is not rendered less likely by the coincidence, almost rather than
correspondence‚ of the date of the completion of the alleged sale with that
of the will, and by the certain fact that the Kildale Manor, etc, with the
Advowson of the Ghurch did pass into the hands of the Northumberland
family very shortly after the date of the said will.

2 He was of the age of fourteen on the death of his father 23 Edw. 1., and
became a ward of the Abbot of Whitby (see No. 417). He acts as witness,
with the title Miles, 8 Edw. IL, and was still living in-l342. His name
occurs so repcatedly in previous pages that further remark seems almost
unnecessary. There is, however, extant an original deed by him, “ dat.
apud Ormesby die Jovis prox. post festum B. M. Virginis A.D. Mocc
quadragesimo secundo,” with his seal appended, bearing the five fussss, pre-
served in the York Museum, which is perhaps of sufficient interest to
justify a notice of it here. In it he is styled Alexander de Percy de
Ormesby, and grants to his son William de Percy “manerium meum de
Ormesby, Caldcotes, et omnia alia terras et tenem'ta mea in Upsale‚ Ormesby
et Caldecotes, cum suis pert., simul cum homagiis et serv. omn. liberorum
