1 A document of considerable interest in several respects, especially as
giving an early and important charter of which we have no other copy, and
also in minor matters, such as establishing the descent of Fulco Dapifer,
and of Aschetin de Haukesgarth, and clearing up some uncertainties of
name, ete„ in other cases.

² The issue of Agnes de Perci by her husband, Jocelin de Louvain, were
Richard de Percy, the eldest son, Henry de Percy, and Matilda. The
latter married John Daivill. On the death of Richard without issue, Henry
succeeded to the entire inheritance. His eldest son was William, who
appears to have married (1) J canna, daughter of William Briwer, by whom
he had only female issue ; and (2) Sibilla de Valoines, his children by whom
were Hem-y de Percy, Engelram, william, Alan, and Joceline. Henry, the
eldest of these, succeeded his father in his honours and estates, and was in
turn succeeded by his son Henry, the author of the present deed, and he
appears to have died about five years after its date.

³ It is worthy of note that this Inspeximus specifies “ cartas Willelmi et
Alani de Percy‚'’ but proceeds to give only that of the latter, notwithstanding
the addition of the precise words “in haec verba.” Is it to be understood
that the charter by Alan de Percy, first recited, is to be regarded as one that
repeats or comprehends that by his father? Cf. Nos. 27 and 279, in the
former of which William de Percy grants “francigenam decimam annonae
hallae” in the several places specified in the present charter, and in the
latter confirms, with the sanction and confirmation of Kin g Henry, ‘⁶ decimas
carucarum de dominio meo ’‘ in the said places. It may be noticed also that
in the charter last referred to the witnesses are the same, with some varia-
tions in spelling, etc. (noticed in the notes on p. 224), and with the fuller
description in the case of Fulco Dapifer‚ as in the chartei· now under notice.
