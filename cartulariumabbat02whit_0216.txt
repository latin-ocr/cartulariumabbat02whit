and N os. 590, 591, are all that are now left in the possession of Sir Charles
Strickland, while No. 592 is a copy of the chief part 01 1116 only document
now left in the same custody of all that had reference to the suit between
Peter de Mauley ΙΙΙ. and the Abbey. According to Charlton, there were in
his time several other rolls still extant having the same connection, while,
with respect to the account-rous, he says (p. 260), ‘⁶ he had several 01 them
before him ;’' and he proceeds to give what he heads as “ Excerpta quaedam
ex Rotulis Coenobii Whitbiensis annis 1394, 1395, et 1396,” limiting his
extracts, however, to the accounts of disbursements. Young also gives
extracts (p. 923) from “ the Roll 01 Disbursements from Martinmas 1394 to
Martinmas 1395,’' having just before given a very few extracts from a
Gompotus “ a festo Pent. A.D. Mocccnx. usque ad idem festum prox.
sequens.'' All are now lost save the three above specified. A copy of the
extracts from the Disbursement Rous, as given by these two authors, will
be found below (No. 592A), but it must be premised that both Charlton and
Young are inaccurate copyists—the former sadly so—and that all attempts
at emendation in places evidently corrupt must be taken for what they are
worth, and no more. It should be added that Young (p. 286, note), states
that in his time “several of the most entire of the Abbey rolls, to which
Charlton had access, have unfortunately fallen aside. Mrs. Cholmley kindly
lent me such as she could find, viz., the compotus receptuum, or rent—roll,
for the half-year from Whitsunday to Martinmas 1396 ; the rent-roll for the
year commencing at Whitsunday 1460 and ending at Whitsunday 1461,
partly mutilated; and an imperfect roll 01 disbursements which appears to
belong to the year 1395 or 1396. . . . Τ116 roll 01 expenditure, though
greatly defective, is 7 feet 5 inches long, and closely written on both sides.
The rent-roll for 1460 is 6 feet 10 inches long, though a part of it has been
lost. That for 1396 is about 4 feet and a half. In some part of these last
the outside 01 1116 roll is written upon, as well as the inside.''
1 This reading is not quite certain.
² The name appears to be written loximer.
