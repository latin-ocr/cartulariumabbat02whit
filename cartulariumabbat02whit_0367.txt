son of John de Menell de Oastle Levington.
IX. 1. John de Percy :2 m. Elizabeth.

1 Alicia de Mennell, described in one document quoted in the Percy
Feod., which will be noted below, as “ fllia J ohannis filii J ohannis de Men-
nell‚’' and erronecusly alleged to have become, after the decease of her
husband John de Percy, the wife of Sir Walter Boynton, was the grand-
daughter of John de Mennell de Oastle Levington and Newby, brother and
eventually heir of the Nieholas de Mennell who intrigued with Lucia de
Latimer (mie Thweng). He succeeded his brother in 1322, his wife being
the lady Katherine named in note 3, p. 700. His son, John de Mennell,
Alicia's father, died before himself, leaving a son, also John de Mennell de
Oastle Levington and N ewby, who died in 134523, Alicia being his heir, as he
had been his grandfather’s. At the date of her brother’s death Alicia was
twenty-two years of age, and the wife of John de Boulton‚ as is known from
the Inq. p. m. of her brother. In 37 Edw. 111. (1263) she was ‘⁶ nuper uxor
Walteri de Boynton ’' (Document quoted in Percy Feod.)‚ and gave to John
de Percy de Kildale, her future husband necessarily (as well as her third),
certain lands in Kildale, the same in point of fact which had been given to
her grandmother by Arnold de Percy. At this time she was about thirty-six
years of age, and probably married John de Percy very shortly after the
execution of the deed just named, which was no doubt a step preliminary to
the intended marriage. The eldest son by this marriage, John, naturally
succeeded to the Kildale and associated mauors, the second son, William de
Percy de Castle Levington, as naturally inherited his mother's lands in Castle
Levington and elsewhere.

2 From this point the Percy Feodary goes hopelessly astray, and no
dependence at all 0011 be placed on its genealogical statements. Next in
succession to John (10 Percy, the husband of Alicia de Mennell, and as their
son and heir, is placed a William (10 Percy, who is represented as concerned
in one deed dated 8 Henr. VI„ as executing another in the 25 Henr. VL, and
yet in the following paragraph as dying l Henry 1v., seised of such and such
mauors, “ut patet per Inquisitionem‚'' ete. As already remarked at the
close of the last note, John de Percy de Kildale, husband of Alicia de Mennell,
was succeeded in his family possessions and appellation by his eldest son
John, who might probably be born about 1365-6. Succeeding (though as a
minor) in 1383, he presented to Kildale Rectory in 1407 and possibly in
1436. But that is uncertain. From his wife Elizabeth's will, dated in
March 1438, it is apparent that he had already sometime since deceased—
she styles herself “quondam uxor Joh. de Percy de Kildale,'' and. makes
mention of her sons William and Henry, and her daughter Elizabeth, besides
John, son of John Percy, probably her grandchild, and of John son of Henry
Percy, her “ filiolus’' (or godchild 2), possibly, or more than possibly, another
grandchild.
