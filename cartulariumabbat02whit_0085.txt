2 “ Turnus, 1116 1011111 or periodica] court of the Sheriff.”—(Stubbs, Selecc
Chao-cers, Gloss.) Held at Whitby 011 1116 part of the Abbot, and so, as will
be seen in 0116 of the account-rolls printed below (No. 589), described as
“ Turnus Abbatis.”

4 The connection of “les amendes de lassise de payne enfreignt‚'' eto.⁷ and
“infangenthef‚'⁷ are so far interesting as to deserve special notice. “The
best definition of the franchise of Infangenthef occurs at p. 518 (Ρίαοὶια de quo
warranto, ed. Record Commission), the more valuable because given 011
behalf of the Crown. The Abbot of Croyland claims gallows and Infangen-
thes, in his manor of Wellingborough,— ⁶ and as to gallows‚’ he says that ‘ he
has Infangenthef in that manor, and 11161 116 01611116 10 have gallows‚ “ quae
erant judiciales et penales‚” for the execution of pleas of the Crown in his
manor aforesaid, by occasion of the liberty aforesaid, and by that warrant
he claims 1ο have the aforesaid gallows in his manor. And 66 10 Τ1111110111
611(1 Pillory‚ he says that he has a view of frafflzpledge, to which appertains
the custody of the assize of bread and beer, and because the aforesaid
Tumbril and Pillory were found for this (inventae ad hoc), that trans-
gressors of the 666126 aforesaid might be conformably punished—to wit,
by the aforesaid Tumbril for breaking the assize of beer, and by the
aforesaid Pillory for the assize of bread not observed. And by that warrant
he claims to have ξ’ judicialia predicta'' for lawfully punishing such trans-
gressors according to the laws and customs of the kingdom of England.²
The King’s attorney replies, and says that, as to Infangenthef‚ the Abbot
ought not to enjoy it, because he, the attorney, says that ‘the liberty of
Infangenthef is a certain royal jurisdiction belonging to the Crown, attribut-
ing power to judge a robber or thief taken with the mainour within the Iord-
shz'p of that lord to whom that liberty is 1φάη ted by the Kiwy, and is not held 10
