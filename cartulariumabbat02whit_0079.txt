of the place named, under the direction and responsibility of the tenants
under the See. Just so the Horngarth had to be made by⁷ the direction and
at the responsibility of the tenants under the Abbey, and by the hands of
their “homines ’' or sub-tenants, of whatever class or description. Allowing
for differences in the system of agriculture in the two districts of Aberdeen-
shire and North Yorkshire, we probably have in the above extract something
which tends to throw light on, and even on the name of, the Horngarth.
Possibly a certain definite extent—analogous to the cottars’ “mod'' at
Fetternear—had to be made up for each head of horned cattle, or of one
sort of horned cattle—com, as at Fetternear—kept on the several vills
above named by the “ villani,'’ “bondarii,'’ “cottarii,'’ ‘⁵ gressmanni ’³ (or by
whatever other name they were designated), living under the lords of the
said vills, as these latter themselves held under the Abbey; and, still
further, most likely the Horngarth itself may really have been the agricul-
tural enclosure surmised in the note above referred to. See also note to
No. 743, infra.

“ Quarel, a stone quarry. Saxifragsium, a qwaryle. Nominale Ms.'’—(Hall.)
The ordinary Oleveland form of the word is learell. Chariton, p. 294, men·
tions an enclosure, lately belonging to the Abbey, and now transferred to
Richard Cholmeley by Henry VIII„ which was called “ Wharell Close.'’

of the Abbot's, and had come of age only in 1302.
