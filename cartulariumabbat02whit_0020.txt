Haec indentura testatur me, Galfridum Rosels,2 ded, 00110, et
per cartas meas sigillatas confirm. Abbati et Conventui Monas-
terii de Whitby, et omnibus success. suis, unum mesuagium 111

bergh3 in Clevelandia, cum omn. suis pert, ut in cartis meis

¹ Headed in a later and ill-written hand as follows :—“falso vero fictus
ut injuste nos constringeret ad inventionem cleriei.”

2 See Nos. 403, 404, wherein this person makes concessions to Whitby in
the same vicinity as in the present deed. The former of these deeds is dated
1312, the second 1318. Galfridus de Rosels is a witness to three charters, all
dated at the same time, in the year 1303, and attested by the same witnesses—
one of them, however, at Werlton (Whorlton)‚ the other two at Hilton in Cleve-
land—by which matters of interest to the Mennells of Hilton were adj usted.
In the one of the two Hilton deeds, John de Mennell de Hilton grants to
Stephen de Roselles the manor of Hilton, with its various homages and other
appurtenances, and certain specified lands in Hilton, Hutton Rudby, etc„ while
in the other the whole is regranted by Stephen de Roselles to John de
Mennell and his wife Sibilla, thus facilitating a new settlement of the said
property. There can be no doubt of the connection between Stephen and
Galh-id, the former of whom appears to have been the more important person,
and to have been connected with Liverton, among other places in 010νο-
land. In No. 28, Roget de Rosel is named as one of Robert de Brus’s*
“tres milites,'’ (lating before 1140; a Stephen de Rosels occurs as witness
in a deed by Adam de Brus ΙΙ. (111 York Museum), executed, therefore, in the
latter part of the same century3 another Stephen de Rosels flourishes in
Abbot Roger’s time (1222-1244)—see No. 352 3 and a third is met with in
the Hilton deeds (preserved at the Friarage, Yarm) cited above, and living
in the earlier part of the fourteenth century.

3 Now Roseberry Topping. Further notice of the various forms assumed
