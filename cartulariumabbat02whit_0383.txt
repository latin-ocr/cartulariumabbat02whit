CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 719

1116 Abbot and Gregory Conyers, citing an agreement made
19 Henry VIII. by Gregory Conyers, that John Hexham, Prior
of Middilsburgh, should be Abbot of Whitby, William Johnson,
Bursar, William Clarkson, Prior of Medilsburgh and N ewham‚
and Richard Hope, Kitchener and Proctor of the Parish Church3
for recognition of which Gregory was to have a tithe-corn of
N ewham and Dunsley.

“ Memorandum.—The 23d year of the reign of our sovereign
lord, King Henry VIIL, after the Convocation, when our master
came home, Ι, Dan Robert Wodhus, Prior, demanded, ‘What
news 2' and he said, ‘ Evil news: sor the King’s grace was
ruled by one common stued huer, Anne Bullan, who made all
the spiritualty to be beggared, and the temporalty also 1⁷
Also, another time, when he came from York, he told the Prior
of a man that preached, and said, when the great wind rose in
the west we should have news afterward. And he asked what
that was. And he said, 3 great man told him at York, and if
he knew as much as three in England he could 1611 what these
news were. And he asked what they were: and he said, the
duke of N orfolk, the earl of VViltshire, and the common stued
huer, Anne Bullan.'’

¹ It has been thought best to print the following pages with as much
fulness as possible on account of the immense mass of curious and precise
information contained as to the several possessions and sources of income
possessed by the Abbey in its prosperity. The details given are so precise,
and descend to such particulars, that, where unfortunately gaps exist, or
omissions—perhaps inevitable under the circumstances—are noticed‚ the
feeling experienced by the student is always that of regret that such defi-
ciencies in the sources of our knowledge do in fact exist.
