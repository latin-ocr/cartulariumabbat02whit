698 CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

The true descent is as follows 1—-
I. Ernaldus de Percy.1
Ia. Ernaldus [07⁴ Ernulfus] de Perey.2
ΙΙ. 1. Ernaldus de Percy.3
2. Robertus [ον Rodbertus] de Ρ616γ.4

ΙΧ. 1. Henry de Percy, aucestor to the Earls of Northumberland, who,
about the fifteenth century, again became lords of Kildale on failure of
lssue.

2. Sir Walter Percy, lord of Kildale (!) in Cleveland.

3. Alice: m. Adam de Stanley (!).

X. l. (Descent continued from the last Walter de Percy, m. to a wife
whose name is not known) Sir Nicholas de Percy, died sp. (Harl. MSS.
1420, p. 19).

2. William de Percy, lord of Kildale 1252 : held in 13 Edw. 1. one knight’s
fee in Nunthorp, Upsall and Arusum ; also one knight's see in Kildale, Cra-
thome, Berwick-on-Tees, Ormesby, Normanby and Lazenby, in Oleveland ;
also lord of the manor of Battersby.

XII. 1. Sir Arnold de Percy de Kildale 1295, and 1312, etc.
2. William de Percy, had Ormesby by the gift of his father, etc, ete.

1 The proofs are as follows 2—Witness with Thomas, Archbishop of York,
to the Foundation Charter of William de Percy, ove les gernuns, to Whitby
(No. 26, p. 32), which dates before 1096.

2 α. Gives to Gysburne Priory (Foundation Charter by Rob. de Brus,
Gysburne Chartul. f. 215) “ ecclesiam de Ormesby, et molendinum de
KaldecoteS, etc.’' He was therefore lord of Ormesby, Kaldecotes, etc., before
1119.

b. Witness to Robert (16 Brus’ charter (No. 111) conveying the Church of
S. Hilda at Middlesburch, etc., to Whitby.

c. Witness, ‘⁶ cum duobus filiis ej us,'’ to the Conventio ‘⁶ inter domum de
Witeby et de Gisburnia” (No. 271), settled before Robert de Brus, and
William de Brus first Prior of Gysburne, probably (or certainly) before 1135.
It is scarcely possible to identify Ι. and 1¹. as certainly the same person.

It is possible, but considering the length of time involved, perhaps hardly
probable.

3 Notum sit etc. quod ego Ernaldus de Percy dono, conc. et conf. elem.
patris mei, quam dedit 6661. S. M. de Gyseburnia—scil. 6661. (16 Ormesby et

making the ‘⁶ duo filii” of Ernaldus Ι. mentioned in No. 271, as is established
by the extract in the next note.
