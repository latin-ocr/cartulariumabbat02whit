¹ pe'cia ret’. To be read no doubt as in the text. Young translates it
“net-money (dues for fishing-nets)‚'’ of course nfistakenly, if the reading
adopted is correct: and that it is may be with some confidenee inferred
from two entries in a rent-roll of Gysburne Priory, belonging to Admiral
Chaloner‚ which, it is hoped, will be printed in the Gysburne Chartnlary.
They occur under the local heading of Thormodeby (now Thornaby, near
Stockton)‚ and are as follows:—-“Pro retibus pendendis apud Hanchbanc,

. . iiii⁰r salmones, vel eorum pretium: inter Puris. B. Mariae et Diem pal-
marum solvendos,'’ and “Pro retibus pendendis in Mandale‚’' with a like
payment. There can bc little or no question that these entries refer to nets
used in the salmon-fishery iu the Tees, and that 1116 nets were stake-ncts—
nets which are suspended, or hung by aid of the so-callecl ‘ stakes.’ There
can be equally little doubt that salmon and salmon-trout abounded in the
Esk in the middle ages—they teem even now—and thus nets like the
suspended nets of the Tees would be in use in the lower reaches of the
Whitby river also.

2 What the las-(lena of herrings may have been is uncertain. A last con-
sisted <and consists) of 10,000, and the price for good herring seems to have
varied between about ae4 and AE5, that is, from 8s. to 103. per thousand.
These ‘lagenae' are valued at something over ls. each, and may be supposed
therefore to have contained about 100 10 125. Dr. Young construes the word
‘ barrels,' without comment. But it must have been a. very small barrel to
contain only so many herrings. Quite possibly it may have been a quarter,
or even a less portion 01 a ‘barreL’ Note the word “ kympe'' in No. 613Α.

³ This is the same as “mixtilis‚” in No. 589, p. 566, but the English
word or name employed instead of the Latin translation. The word
blendcorn, for wheat and rye mixed, is still in use in the district, though
the growth of the crop has nearly or quite ccased. Cf. Sw. Dial. blamlko‘rn,
mixed rye and oats, Dan. blamlkorw, meslin.
