¹ In all probability this is the old name of what is now known as Breaday
Heights, unless we suppose that, according to the usual signification of
⁶ head‚' when subjoined to dale, it denotes the very beginning of the valley
as it opens out in the hills. In that case it would be the highest part of
Breaday-gill.

2 The reading of this word is uncertain. It may be Haywaythil, and pos-
sibly it might be a clerica] error for Haywayclif. Still it should be noted
that the name Haywaygate occurs infra, suggesting that Haywayhill, if not
Haywayehil for Haywaykeld‚ is quite a possible reading.

3 See No. 276, where “ fons de Haradale’' 16 named. See also note 9
under No. 280.

4 ‘ Sty’ is the old word for a pathway or track up a steep bank or hill-side.
In one or two instances, known to the editor, the name yet remains in 1166 iu
the Dales part of the Cleveland district, while as applied to a ladder it is of
universal adoption. There is a Silpho Brow farm, and the track that leads
to and from it is in parts quite sufficiently steep.

5 The reading here again, unassisted as one is by the survival of the name
or a form of it, is uncertain. It may, as the letters stand, be Rothondale or
Rochondale, and it is quite impossible to decide which.
