¹ In the Museum at Scarborough‚ among other ancient documents pre-
sented by the late Capta'm Richardson, is a deed by Hillaria, daughter of
Thomas de Joneby, giving power of attorney to William de Bovington, son
of William de Bovington, in the matter of a certain rent payable to the
Prioress of Munketon (Nun Monkton) out of lands in Acelum (Adam), held
by the said William de Bovington, the date of the deed being 1311. A
Thomas de Joneby is also named in the Malton Cartulary (Cott. MSS.
Claud. D. xi.)‚ f. 68, as having married Joan, one of the daughters of Robert
Manyvylain. The Wflliam de Joneby of the present deed, “ noster serviens,''
is probably a descendant, or at least connection.

2 As this deed is dated in 1350, the Abbot ruling at the time must have
been Thomas de Haukesgarth.

3 “ On the east side of the Esk, Kirkgate has received very large additions.
No street in Whitby has obtained a greater variety of names; for, besides
the ancient name K'irlcgyate, it has been called at various periods, H iqlryate,
Hiyh Street, Crossgyate, Sozctlzqata Churclzyate, and, lastly, Clzurch Screel.
The particular times when these names were severally adopted, or laid aside,
it is impossible to state with precision‚ for all of them are used ‘in various
writings, between the years 1600 and 1700, and sometimes three of them
occur in one writing. Southgtate was perhaps not the name of the whole
street, but only of that part of it which lay south from the end of Grape
Lane. The name Ohurch Street has superseded all the rest for near a
century.''—(Young's leitby, p. 480.)
