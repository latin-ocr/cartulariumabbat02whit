(63) Hoc scr. cyrograffatum testatur quod cum controversia
mota fuisset inter viros Relig„ Abb. et Conv. Monasterii de
Whiteby, et Alexandrum de Percy,1 Militem, super quibusdam
servitiis quae praedicti Abb. et Conv. ab eodem Alexandro
exigent pro manerio de Snetona, quod ipse Alexander de eisdem
Abb. et Conv. tenet infra libertatem de Whiteby z—Idem
Alexander, pro se et haer. suis, per pr. scriptum recognoscit
