2 Halliwell gives “strake of a cartewheele wherein the spokes be sette,
Elyot, Ed. 1559 ;” “ vietus, a hoope or strake of a carte.”-(Ibid.) Carr has
“stralo-er, the iron rim of 6 wheel.’' The plouyh-strake is the strip of iron
along the land side of the plough.

3 “ Mold-board-clouts. Plates of iron which protect the mould-board,
or projecting side, of the plough, from the wear and tear of the earth and
stones it meets with.’'—(Hall.)

4 Young writes in explanation of this term, “ The Fae-house? without
stating what the see—house meant. Fe-hows might mean a treasury ; O. N.
fe-hus has that signification, as well as that of a stall. Ο. Sw. foehus is a
cattle-house ; Sw. Dial. fids, as well as Ο. Ν. fjo'3‚ is the same, and to the
former of these two belong 6 great number of variations in form. The
building designated‚ from the items given, was of some considerable size, and
it may possibly mean 6 strong-room, 01· treasury, in which the valuables of
the Abbey were kept3 the thesaurus, in short, so often mentioned. in A,
There seems to have been 6 special keeper, or at least one so specially con·
nected with its analogue in other places, that he took his designation from it.
Thus William del Fehus, son and heir of Simon de Brus (a brother of Peter
de Brus 11.) gave land at Lofthouse to Gysburne.
