1116 said John, he came with an armed force, and carried away what
he called his 1111165 υἱ et armis ,· on which the Abbot and Convent 01
Whitby complained to the Archbishop of York, who threatened to
depose and excommunicate this John of Tocotes unless 116 immediately
restored all these tithes he had forcibly carried away. These tithes were
accordingly restored, but a prosecution was commenced by him against the
Abbot and Convent of Whitby, wherein he claimed not only the before-
mentioned 1111165, 10111 also the parish church 01 St. Mary itself, situate near
the Abbey gates, asserting it to be subordinate 10 and dependent 011 1115
parish church at Lyth. The cause being tried at common law before spiritual
judges, a verdict was gained against John 01 Το60165 ; 10111 116, 1101 satisfied
therewith, appealed to Rome, on which his Holiness issued a Bull, wherein
he appointed judge—delegates here in Yorkshire to inquire into the affair, and
to give him a faithful account thereof. Hereupon a commission was held
about Candlemas, anno 1283, and the depositione of many witnesses were
taken, viz.‚ on behalf of the Abbot and. Conveni: 01 Whitby, those of Geoffrey
Penoc of Whitby, aged 49 years3 01 Andrew Scot, priest 01 St. Mary’s at
Whitby, aged 50 years3 01 Lawrence, a blacksmith in Whitby, aged 80
years3 of John Hersand of Whitby, aged 50 years3 01 Ρ6161· of Lincoln‚
aged 50 years ; 01 John of Everley, aged 60 years 3 of Alexander of Cotom,
aged 41 years3 of Thomas, chaplain of Hackness‚ aged 60 years; 01 Μο565 01
Whitby, aged more than 100 years, being the oldest man in Whitby Strand ;
01 Robert, the son of Walter 01 Whitby, aged 60 years 3 and of Henry, the
son 01 Alan 01 Whitby, aged also 60 years. Every one of these being
separately examined, deposed, That Thordesay Beck, which issued out of
Mulgrave Park‚ was the western limit of Whitby parish ; that the bounder
went from thence to Merhoue, near the corner 01 1116 Ηο15661011; 110111
thence to Swarthouecross, and from thence right down Brocholey Beck to
the river Eske: That it was public, notorious, and manifest to all those who
lived in Whitby Strand, that the Church 01 St. Mary at Whitby had for time
immemorial, and as they verily believed from its first foundation, belonged
to the Abbot and Convent of Whitby, who in right thereof had ever received
tithes from all these places which were now claimed by John of Tocotes and
Lord Peter de Malo-lacu. On the contrary, John 01 Το60165’ witnesses swore
positively that the manor of Mulgrave extended to the river Eske ; but not
being able 1ο disprove the premises now in dispute being in the possession 01
1116 Abbot and Gonvent of Whitby, they deposed, That, some ages before
this, William Fossard, the lord of the aforesaid manor‚ mortgaged the same
to the Abbot and Convent 01 Whitby, who, 011 account of that mortgage, had
fraudulently got possession. To overthrow this evidence, more witnesses
