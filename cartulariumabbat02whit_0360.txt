A descent of the Percyes of Kildale according to ancyent

euidences.1
I. William de Percy‚ came in with Williain [the] Con-
, 22
quffianHan de Percy.
ΙΠ. 1. Walter Percye, lord of Kildale, tempore Henr. 1.3

2. William de Percye, filius et haeres.
3. Allan Percy ; iiius filius.
4. Gerfraye Percye ; iiiitus filius.

1 As several references have been made to this question in the preceding .
pages‚ and as the published Pedigrees of Percy of Kildale, of which Ord’s
(Hist. of Glevelama 426) may be taken as a fair sample, are beyond doubt
utterly erroneous, it has been thought better to insert a short notice of the
true descent of that family, with the requisite proofs.

2 The pedigree is in the form of a descending stem with circles on either
side, one to receive the name of the man, the other that of his wife, and
from side-lines 011 either side of the main stem depend other circles, to re-
ceive the names of the issue, so arranged that the son through whom the
descent continues is always nearest the descending stem, and to his circle is
united another by a cross-bar, for his wife's name. In the text Ι merely
give the contents of the said circles, numbering them where necessary, as in
the preceding genealogical notes, down to the point at which the Kildale
family is supposed to branch off from the main family. Allowing for the
expansions, what is printed above is an exact copy. On either side of the
stem with its circles, and in the horizontal interspaces between the circles
are notes, comments, and extracts from charters, etc., illustrative of the
acts or history of the several persons more prominently named.

³ The side—note to this personage's circle 13 :—

Kildale. This Walter was Lo[rd] of Kildale and Ormesby and others
about the time of King Henry L, and was 2[nd] sonne to Allane, Lo. Percy,
and Emme, his wife, daughter to Gilbert de Gante, Erle of Kyme and Barron
of Tinsley in Lincolnshire.
