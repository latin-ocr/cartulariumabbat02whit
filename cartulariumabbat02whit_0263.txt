¹ A panel 15 properly “a piece of cloth on a horse's back to serve as a
sort of saddle. The general sense is ‘ a piece,’ and especially a square piece,

whether of wood, eloth, or parchment, but orig. of eloth only. O. F. pamel,
later paneau, ‘ a pannel of wainscot, of a saddle, etc.,' Cot.''—(Skeat's Etym.
Dict.) ‘Howse' is the old form, or one of the old forms, of the modern
word ‘ housing’ :—“ the old form was houss, the addition -ings being
English. . . . ‘ Housse, the eloth which the King‘s horse-guards wear behind
the saddle ; ' Cole's Dice„ ed. 1684.''—(Skeat.) ⁴ Sellas' 15 written ‘ cellas?

2 Some part of the trappings of a horse, but uncertain what. The ‘ head-
stall' is the halter or head-gear of the horse by which it 15 secured in its
stall, or led to water, made of hemp.

³ The Fitts, low-lying lands by the river-side, near Whitby.

4 Unintelligible‚ and probably miscopied. Salt was largely manufactured
at Cotum, Redoar, Wilton, etc„ as well as beyond the Tees, and a Journey
for the purpose of procuring salt is doubtless here indicated. ?visitanti.
