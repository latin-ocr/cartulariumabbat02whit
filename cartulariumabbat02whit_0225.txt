¹ There⁸ 1s no apparent philological explanation, or clue to the origin, of this
word. It is apparent that it stands for certain ‘⁶ animalia‚'' but as to creatures
of what sort, that is matter of question. It may be remarked that sheep and
lambs, oxen, cows, a calf, and (presumably) a pack-horse, porkers and fatted
boars, together with geese, are all named in the catalogue of animals sold. This
uarrows the question as to what “ pedelakis ’' may represent very materially.
Consideration of the price obtained for them, whatever they were, narrows
it still further. A “pedelake '² of the better quality fetched (3d., of an in-
ferior character, 4d. The porker eost a shilling, the “ frank '' from lsss. to
23s. 4d., the ox and cow were severally worth lOs. and Ss, while the sheep
rated at 6d. and ls. each, and the lambs at 4d. Fourpence each was also
received for the geese. It is clear then that the “pedelake’' was nothing
so insignificant as a duek or a fowl (the latter of which was valued at 2d.‚
it will be remembered), and there is really nothing in the way of stock that
remains to be named, except pigs just off the mother—in short, if not the
“ sucking-pig'' of savoury flavour, yet still a newly weaned store-pig. But
there is a further question involved in the name—that is to say, Is the final
portion of it——the syllable or syllables lakes—identical with the lakes which
are found joined with the words gallinis and ovis ? In No. 591 we find, in
the corresponding part of the roll, the item “ de xiii porcellis de pament0,’'
which are valued at between 3d. and 4d. each. May not ‘⁴ pedelakis'' be
equivalent to “porcellis de pamento '⁷¹2 “ Decimae porcellorum '' are men-
tioned in No. 291, and “ tithe—pig '⁷ is ahonsehold word, and it is a matter
almost of certainty that there were other offerings or dues analogous to, but
over and above, those of fowls and eggS, and of probability that the crea-
tures meant by “pedelakis '' were of that description, and, by the circum-
stances, are limited to pigs of tender age.
