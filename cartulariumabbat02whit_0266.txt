¹ Dr. Young here gives a reference to a former page (325) of his H istory,
on turning to which, we find a notice of the law-suit between Peter de
Mauley 111. and the Convent, and in a note (p. 327) what follows :—“ This
iniquitous attack on their property was attended with great expense to the
monks; for in the Roll of Expenditure for 1394-5‚ 15 this entry, ‘ It. in ex-
pensis, etc.‚' as above. So that the trial eost them near 0645, though their
adversaries were condemned to pay the expense8.'' Other remarks follow,
and one is that “the final decision was delayed till eleven years after the
examination now related,’' etc. The blundering here is most extraordinary
and outrageous. The date of the settlement of the dispute was 1283, and
is so stated by Young himself (p. 325), and this item in the disbursements is
entered in a roll belonging to 1392, not 11 but 111 years afterwards ! What
this new “ causa'' between the Rector of Lythe and the Convent at the end
of the fourteenth century may have been, there is at present no evidence to
show.

2 Printed oieb„ but read erroneously‚ surely.

3 A swill is “ a shallow open willow or wicker basket of light or open con-
struction‚'’ used in gathering potatoes, and many other husbandry operations.
Can is also a word of special local use, as water-can for water-poc, and so
forth.

¹³ Hanwell gives Plock as a Devonshire word for a hurdle. The modern
Oleveland form is fleeak, which is the pronunciation either of flake or flook
(cf. ι1011001ιί101· school, deear for door, deeam for dame, ete). ln the Olez’elami
Glossary the form given is ‘⁴ flakes, pronounced flealcs or fleeaks.''
