2 N amed in his father’s will (d. 1282), Test. Ebor. i. 123, and Archbp.
Neville's Register, f. 44¹0.

3 The ‘Descent’ places a John de Percy in this generation, but makes
him a younger brother of another William de Percy, who is dealt with as
the elder son, and made to be, as already noticed, the father of Christiana (of
note 2 on last page). He, the said John de Percy, is in reality the eldest son
and heir of the last John de Percy (l of Generation 1x., and see note 2, p. 703),
who is distinguished from him by the apposition of Senior to his name when
mentioned (Test. ΕΗΖ. de Percy de KHdale, March 4, 1433). He seems to
have died without a will, letters of Administration of John Percy de Kildale
“qui ob. intest.’' having been granted in Feb. 144} to John and William
Fenton of Kildale. An Inq. p. m. Joh. de Percy (of course the same), who
held the Manor of Kildale, one carucate in Crathorne, lands, etc„ in Kilburn,
at Thirsk, etc„ was held at Thirsk 22 Henr. VI. (144325), in which John de
Percy, of the age of ten years and upwards, is named as his son and heir,
He presented to Kildale, possibly in 1436, and certainly in 1440.

4 In the Inquisitio specified in the last note, John de Percy, lately deceased,
is stated to have held the Manor of Upsel within the liberty of Richmond,
having been enfeoffed therein jointly with Elizabeth his wife, who was
then surviving‚ by William Percy Esquire and Thomas Malbysh.

⁵ All three mentioned in the will of their mother above notieed. It is
almost certain, moreover‚ that the William de Percy named in the following
extracts is the William de Percy here particularised :-“ William Sheparde
of Hoton juxta Gisborne did release to this Will. Percy the 7th all his right
and clame that he had in certen lands and tenements in Kildale, by deede
dated 8 Henr. VI. (1433). And after, scil. 25 Henr. VI. (1443), the said Will.
Percy gave the landes aforesaid to Will. Parkinson and his heires.’'—(Percy
Feod. Das-cent.)

⁶ Named in the Inq. p. m. of his father (see note 3, supra) as “aetatis x
annorum” at that date (14423). He presented to Kildale March 18, 147ξ, and
appears to have died in 1501. At least there is a will by a John de Percy
of that date (Rey. Tesc. vi. 3), who gives directions that he be buried “in
medio chori Eccl. S. Cuthberti de Kildale‚'’ whose identity with this youth-
ful heir of 144} it is necessary, rather than only safe, to infer. He mentions
in the said document his sister Elizabeth (her mother and grandmother, as
well as one of her aunts, on our assumption, having also been called by that
name), and another sister Isabella ; and his two sons, Peter and J ames,
