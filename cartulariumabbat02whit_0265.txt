lation of Gr. κόκκος, given to the insect from its resemblance to a seed or
kernel, whence the colour dyed with it was called κόκκινος, or in L. coccineusss'
-(Wedgw.‚ Etym. Dict.)

1 Wedgwood in v. Quire (of paper), says, ‘⁴ there is no reason to doubt that
it 18 formed from Lat„ quaternio.''

2 Young subjoins in explanation of this word “viz. of lterrinys .·'⁷ on what
ground is not apparent, understanding the word itself to mean “cask.” It may
perhaps be almost or entirely synonymous with layena of No. 590 (see supra,
p. 577, note 2), and possibly may give some 01110 to the shape of the lassena.
Pr. Pm. has “Kym1yne‚ or kelare, vesselle. Ounula,’' kimlin in Cleveland
being 3 large tub or earthenware 1708801 used in bread-making ; ‘keeler‚’
in Essex, having the same meaning. The word looks like 3 derivative, and
may connect itself with kympe 01· kymbe. The ·' kymp’ probably was a
barrel or tub, somewhat pail-shaped maybe‚ capable of holding about two
hundred and. fifty herrings. Tubs of that shape‚ and used for like purposes,
were not uncommon.

3 Young appends here “St. Leonard's Day‚” but mistakenly, as beyond
question, the 3000 herrings here speeified will be the 3000 annually rendered
by Whitby under the convention with the Master of St. Leonard's at York.
See No. 295, etc.

poulterer, the Abbot’s cook, Thomas Percy, the bailiff, the miller, the cooks,
John Reston, and the baker, Amount, 33s.'’
