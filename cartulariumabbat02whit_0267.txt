¹ “Lm to castrate.' ’—(Olevel. G‘Zoss.) The operation seems to have been
performed by slicing off the lower part of the scrotum, and removing the
testicles through the orifice. “Pig-gelder'' seems also to have been the
title of a special agricultural operator. The word occurs in the lengthy
sword-dance recitation which used to be heard in this district.

² Young’s comment here is: “The horses, it seems, had an additional
allowance on the day of St. Louis or Loy, the patron of smiths.” His autho-
rity for the supposition is not apparent.

³ The salt fish when dry would be bound together in bundles—a usage
not yet discontinued. Cord is still the generic name for string, of all sorts.

4 “Skope‚ instrument. Vama, Cath. alveolus.''-(Pr. Pm.); and Hall.
gives “ Scope, a kind of basin with a handle used for lading water3’' as
also “seoop, a shovel used by maltsters. The term is generally applied to
an instrument used for scooping out anything.”

⁶ The reading here may not be quite certain. The apparatus denoted is
probably the wooden shoulder-piece‚ cut to fit the back and shmilders, to
each end of which is affixed a means of suspending the bucket.

6 Obba is a cup, goblet‚ or bowl for drinking from. What the liyacura
obbarum may be is obscure.
