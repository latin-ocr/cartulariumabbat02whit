366 CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

ligabit, vel metet, semel in anno; stagnum faciet3 cariabit

cum averiis occidendis, ubicunque Abbas sujurnare voluerit:

pleting the work of thatching is, “to have got all covered in.’' Meiere
coopertorium is, probably, to mow rushes for thatch3 rushes, or, locally, seres,
being still largely employed for that purpose, especially when straw runs
short.

1 Mola is a millstone. The duty or service “ cariandi molam '' is a recog-
nised one in similar cases. Thus in Boldon Buke, p. 39, among many similar
instances, is this :—“ Concessit etiam Dominus Episcopus quod omnes prae-
dicti homines de praefatis villis . . . quieti sint . . . de molis molendini
cariandis ;'’43 and again at p. 37 : “ Drengus pascit canem et equum, et . . .
quadriget i tonnellum vini, et molam molendini.'’59 In other places the
words employed in place of “molam molendini ‘⁹ are “lapidem molendini.’'

² See No. 273, and note 5 011 p. 218. This is by no means a solitary
instance of the existence of studs of practically wild mares, who with their
young, until such age as they could be made available for work,were allowed to
roam at will in the open pasturage. Siniilar cases are met with, to name but
one instance, in the Rievaulx Chartulary. Thus (f. 67¹³) Bernard de Baliol
makes grant—“ Communam pasturam lx matribus equabus eum nutrimento
suo per totam forestam meam de Thesedale, ita ut pulli et pultrae earum, cum
aetatem ii annorum habuerint, inde removebuntur.’' The eharter, a little
further on, proceeds thus: “ Concedo etiam eis omnia asiamenta in praedicta
foresta mea; scil. materiam ad faldas faciendas ad equas illaqueandas, et
logias ad opus pastorum, . . . et ut in praedicta pastura animalium—scil.
infra Egleshope 01 Stodeshope faciant logias ad opus pastorum animalium, et
faldas ad opus animalium ; 01 ut libertatem habeant per totam terram meam
eundi et redeundi, et ducendi animalia sua ad pasturam, et reducendi.⁷’
And without dwelling upon the possible significance of the name “ Stodes-
hope,’' it is plain from this extract, even had it not been abundantly apparent
on the surface, that the work of catching the wild mares and their progeny
must have been one involving some labour and preparation, both of such a
nature as to require the services of not a few men. Almost certainly, there-
fore, as 3ίόιί 15 1110 Ο. English form of modern E. stud (A. Sanc. stod, O. Icel.
516111, Ο. Η. Germ. stuot, stud, equitium, Hick. thes. 1. 231 ς stood, Gow.
3. 204 ; stede, Percev. 326 2—Stratman’s O. Ε. Βὶείὶοηανῃ), 1110 phrase
“ibit ad stod'' implies the rendering of such service by each Hackness
cotarius on the occasions when the brood mares and their young had to be
caught (illaqueari) as might be required for the purpose, both in making up
the faldae, and in driving and seeuring the animals.

3 There is conceded in one of the charters in the Gysburne Cartulary, my
reference to which is unluckily mislaid, a special liberty to gather nuts
within a. certain part of the forest land of Moorsum. That entry, together
with this, is sufficient to show that even the wild nuts were of importance 111
the dietary of the day.
