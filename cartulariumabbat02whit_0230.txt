brought into port; and as all these payments, as well as those of tithe,
would naturally and necessarily be paid in kind, there must have been a
large stock accumulated from time to time in the Abbey ‘fish-house’ (or
‘houses ²). And probably (not to say almost certainly) the ‘Northsefare'
and ‘ heringfare ' entries depend on the sales of part of the said stock. The
term ‘land-heringfare' thus at once assumes a definite and reasonable
meaning z—viz. dues paid in kind on catches of herring ‘ landed' at Whitby.
As to the phrase ‘herring-fare‚⁷ Ι would add that it is not out of use in
Whitby even yet. Mr. F. K. Robinson, author of the Whicby Glossary, in-
formed me a few years back that he still heard it from time to time, in some
such form as “no laek of heo-ringyfare,'⁷ ‘⁶ a vast of lzerrz‘n9fa7·e‚” in con nec-
tion with large takes of the fish in question. “ Lentynfare '' and “ winter-
fare ’' explain themselves, as being most likely dependent on the offerings of
different kinds of provisions made at those seasons of the year to eeclesias-
tical persons and bodies by parishioners and dependants. Easter·dues and
Yule—tide or Christmas dues would all be paid in kind for long, and great
accumulations in the case of a House like the Abbey would ensue. As
to the meaning of ‘halfare’ or ‘holfare,' I am unable to offer any ex-
planation.

¹ Inferior grain falling away from the better and weightier corn in the
progress of ‘dressing:⁷ to this day called in Cleveland ‘ offal-corn‚'
‘ offal' itself depending on two words, off and fall (see Skeat, Etym. Dict.
in v.). The equivalent word in more southerly districts is ‘tail-corn.'
There is still a third description of grain resulting from the process of
‘dressing‚' usually called here ‘hen-meat] and by Halliwell (under Tail-
corn) “droam'’ or “ undercorn,'' which he describes as “so light and inferior
as to be given to poultry.''
