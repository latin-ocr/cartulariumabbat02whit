³ One of the special Percy Castles in the north. Henry de Percy, father
of Harry Hotspur, was the baron at the date of this payment.

2 Young writes here, ‘⁴ Ziverz’es for che servcmts,'' taking the word in its
modern acceptance in that connection. Pr. Pm. has “ Livverey of clothe, or
other 3yftyS. Liberata, Libeo·atu⁷·a‚’' to which 15 appended a very full and
admirable note by the editor on the general subject of the ancient ‘livery.'

whom things had been given, were more likely to be, it would seem, the
servants of his noble host than his own. Who the D'nus J ohannes may have
been is uncertain. Some one in the Abbot’s own household probably, as we
find in the next entries the money for seven more liveries‚ apparently con-
