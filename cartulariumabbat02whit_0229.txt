¹ There is here, and in the three entries next succeeding, matter of great
uncertainty. Two of these terms-—“holfare '⁷ and “ land-hering-fare ''—arc
met with again in No. 590, under the head of “Portus de Whitby‚⁷'
besides yet another—“ North se fare ‘'-and Young's questioning suggestion
of “groundage⁷’ as the possible meaning of “honam'’ (Whitby Panorama,
p. 284), of ‘⁶ North-sea-dues ” for “ Northsefare,'' and of “dues for landing
and selling hcrrings '' for “land hering—fare,'’ suffice to show the perplexity
they occasioned him. It would almost seem that an approximate solution
of the doubt may depend on the meaning to be assigned to the clement sare
found in all these terms. In the first place, fare never means ‘duel In
Wedgwood’s words, cognate with “Goth. faran, O. N. fara, G. fabren, Ε.
fare, fundamentally ⁷² it means “ to g0‚ then to get on, to do, with reference
to the luck we meet with in our progress through life; to fare well or ill,
to be prosperous or the contrary, to meet with good or bad entertainment ;
and hence fare, entertainment, focd.'' In ‘to pay one's faress the reference
of course is to the former of these two meanings, and the meaning of fare
in the terms under notice must connect either with it or with the sense food
—either with the sense in ‘ way-farer ' or with that in ‘ sumptuous fare.' Bnt
independently of the inference as to which of the two senses must he in-
volved afforded by “lentynfare‚'' the sense of journeying (or even the much
later sense of payment for facilities of journeying) is altogether inapplicable,
on the face of it. We are thus throwu upon the conclusion that fare in
each of the terms in question means food‚ or what is to be used as food.
“Herring—fare'’ then would mean a supply of food consisting of herrings‚
and “Northsefare'’ a supply of food derived from the North Sea; and the
specifications accompanying the term “ N orthsefare '' come in quite
appositely in support of the inference, for the said ‘fare' consisted of 628
kelings and 140 coles and codlynges, the kelings being large cod (see Hall.
in v., who gives an instance from Havelok) and coles the ordinary eoal-fish,
both of which, together with the codlings named, are the produce of the
‘deep-sea’ or ‘North-Sea’ fishery. It is scarcely necessary to say that
tithes of fish taken or brought into Whitby Harbour by Whitby fishermcn
were paid to the Abbot and Convent, and No. 374 gives an illustration of a
practioal application of the rule. But it is idle to suppose that stranger
fishermen would have nothing to pay on such fish as they caught -and
