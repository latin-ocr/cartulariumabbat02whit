2 “ Another hermitage belonging to Whitby,” says Young (p. 362), “ was
at a place called Hode, on the moors beyond Helmsley 3 where Robert de
Alnetto, a monk of Whitby, lived for some time3 but, in 1138, Roger de
Mowbray and Gundreda, his mother, purchased the place from our monks,
and founded there a Cistercian Abbey, which was afterwards removed to
Byland.” And in a note he adds, rather inconsistently—“Our monastery
received, in exchange for Hode a dwelling-house at Foss-bridge in York3
besides the remission of the service due 011 account of their lands in
Tollestun‚'’ with three references to A„ two of which, Nos. 238, 259, will be
noticed presently‚ but the other appears to have no connection with the
matter in hand. The Whitby historiali then continues : “ Charlton, as usual,
adorus this subject with his conjectures. Among other things, he states
that Robert de Alnetto was dead when this hermitage was purchased and
converted into an Abbey; whereas it appears from Dugdale’s Monastz'con
(i. p. 1028), that Robert became one of the inonks under Gerald, the first
Abbot of Hode.’' Young’s expression, “adorned the subject with his con-
jectures,’⁷ is a very mild way of stating the case. The circumstantia] details
given by Charlton‚ at p. 69, (10 singular credit to his imagination as well as
to his unflinching boldness of assertion. But without noticing the details of
this veracious piece of ‘history,’ it may be enough to say that no valid
ground whatever for the allegation that there was a hermitage at Hode
belonging to Whitby is known to the Editor. It is clear from No. 259 that
Whitby had a claim upon “the Church of St. William of Hod,” as, on the
other hand, from No. 238, had the said church on land at Butterwick
belonging to the Abbey of Whitby. Young at 3 later page (p. 400) says—
“ Robert de Alnetto, master of the hospital at Spital Brigg, and founder of
the hermitage, or cell, at Hode, was a N orman of noble birth, being a near
relation to Gundrey Mowbray (“avunculum suum sive nepotem'’)‚ under whose
patronage he settled at Hode. When that place was made an Abbey, in
1138, through the bounty of that lady and her son Roger, he still continued
in it under Gerald, the first Abbot‚ and probably abode there until his
‹leath‚'’ which is reasonable enough. That there was, as Young hesitatingly
says, “ a hermitage, or cell at Hode’' is no doubt true ; that Whitby had some
claim on it or the lauds assigned to it, or its successor the Abbey, is certain 3
but that it in any sense belonged to the Abbey of Whitby by no means
follows from such a concession or conclusion. It is noteworthy that the
name de Alneto——Young persists in writing it Alnetto—is identical with the
origin or early form of the modern family name Dawnay, and that it occurs
more than once in the present Chartulary3 thus in No. 63 Guillehnus de
Aunei is among the witnesses, and in No. 466 (dated in 1307) a Matthew
Dauney attestS. In the charter, of which, as not only pertinent to the
matter in hand but of considerable interest in itself, a copy is given below,
