Roger de Bayus (see No. 234 and note 2, p. 107); that the said Roger de
Bayus held lands to some considerable extent in Ormesby, of one of the manors
of which the aforesaid Wilh'am de Percy died seised 3 and that the name of
his wife, Johanna, under these circumstances is not a little suggestive. If
we suppose her to have been one of the just noted female heirs of J ohanna
Arundel, and that the advowson of Sneton was part of her heritage, the
difficulty as to the passing of the advowson and lordship of Sneton to a
branch of the Kildale Percy family is solved.
