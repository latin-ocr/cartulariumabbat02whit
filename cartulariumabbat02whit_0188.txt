2 One would gladly identify this place with the dale or vale through which
the Brocholebeck, named in Nos. 190, 191, etc„ flows, if it were possible, or
even reasonably probable. The only local clue throughout, in our ignorance
of what and where Midethet—hardly corrupted out of Midethwait at that
early date—and Thuf were, is that the boundary of the land granted started
from a certain “ balk ’⁷ which lay between the wandales of de Percy's
demesne, and those of his homagers. Now, there is reason to suppose that
the lord's residence lay on the seaward side of the site of Dunsley Chapel,
and probably the vandelae named lay north of the chapel and hall. If this
were so, one might perhaps trace the name Broccheshole in Trucky Rock
Hole, which is marked on the G-ineh Ordnance Survey, about one-third of a
mile north of the South Lodge (admitting to the Mulgrave woods)‚ and just
a little to the west side of the drive. It is not likely that the area enclosed
was very considerable, and the entire delineation is extremely obscure.

3 Vivien Presbiter attests No. 43, a charter by Robert de Percy, son of
Pichot de Percy, and a cotemporary of the grantor of the present charter ;
and also No. 67, another charter by the same grantor, as Vivian' Presbiter de
Ugalbardeby‚ etc.

4 Ricardus de 1311116616 6116616 No. 65, by the same donor.

5 He too attests No. 43 3 as also No. 208 by the author of the present deed.
