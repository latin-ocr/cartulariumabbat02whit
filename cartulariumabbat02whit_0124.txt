2 Next to the tenants in knight service, in post-Conquest times, are found
“the freemen, bound to render service, other than military service, in
money, produce, attendance at the lord's court, or labour3 or rather, as
they would be called after the Conquest, free tenants holding by such
service. In Domesday we find these tenants spoken of as sochemamzi,
socmcmmi, or liberi socmccnni. The derivation of the word has given rise to
much controversy : . . . but there can be little question that it is connected
with soca, soen, ‘jurisdiction,’ from A.-s. secan, ‘to seek.’ The free land-
owners had probably by the time of the Conquest been brought nearly
universally into the condition of persons owing suit or attendance at the
court of some great man. Thus the sochemanm' are probably the free suitors
or attendants (secta, sequor) of the lord’s court, who came in process of time
to be regarded as tenants holding in socagye, by the tenure of such suit or
service. The services to which they were bound seem to have been usually
fixed or certain, and not capable of being exacted arbitrarily by the lord,
such as the rendering of a certain amount of agricultural service, or having
a fixed rent in money or produce. Sometimes a free tenant would only be
bound by the oath of sealty. In process of time the nature of the services
rendered, especially the characteristic of fixity or certainty, came to be
regarded as the mark of a distinct species of freehold tenure called free
socage.

“ Socage tenure is thus described by Lyttleton, who wrote in the reign of
Edward IV. :—⁴ Tenure in socage is where the tenant holdeth of his lord the
tenancy by certain service for all manner of services, so that the service be
not knight's service. As where a man holdeth his land of his lord by fealty
and certain rent for all manner of services 3 or elsewhere a man holdeth his
land by homage, fealty, and certain rent for all manner of services3 or
where a man holdeth his land by homage and fealty for all manner of
services; for homage by itself maketh not knight's service.' There can
be little doubt that tenure in socage is the successor of the allodial pro-
prietorship of early times. The chief characteristics of socage tenure were—
(l.) On the death of a tenant in socage the land, if ‘antiquitus divisum,⁷
descends to all the sons. This was the case in Glanvill's time. (2.) The
socage tenant is free from the obligation to military service by reason
of tenure, nor is he always bound to render homage to his lord. The oath
of fealty is universal, and sometimes constitutes his sole service. Whatever
additional service is due from him must be fixed and certain3 the most
usual was a fixed payment of rent. (3.) Some of the ‘ incidents ⁷ of tenure
by knight-service had their counterpart in tenure in socage⁴ The socage
