potuit, et inde producit sectam, etc., et si hoc non sufficit offert ponere se
super jur’, etc.’'—(Add. MSS„ Br. Museum, 12,269; Placita et Assisae, 1-24
Henr. 111.)

“ Agnes de Flammavile, mother of Walter de Percy of Kildale (printed
Basedale)‚ gave one oxgang of land here (in Kildale)‚ which the said Walter
confirmed.'’—(Burton‚ lifou. Ebor. 251.)

1 Walterus de Percy confirms to Gysburne, “ quicquid Willelmus de Percy,
pater meus, vel antecessores ejus, d.‚ c. et confirmaverunt, tam in ecclesiis
quam in t'ris et tostis in Ormesby et in molendino de Caldecotes‚’' besides
making many other donations—(Gysb. Chartul. f. 216.)

“ Omnibus etc. . . . Walterus de Percy, etc. Noverit univ. vestra quod
ego concessi et hac pr. c. m. conf. Abbati et Conv. de Rivalle molendinum
de Fritona quod vocatur Pokera cum secta et multura hominum meorum
sicut carta Hugonis avunculi mei testatur.'’-—(Percy Feodary.) Hubert de
Cammevfle was the grantor of the said charter according to Burton (splon.
Ebor. 360) ; but it is not improbable that Burton has miscopied both Christian
and surname, and that the Charter (copy of which is given in the Percy
Feodary, as a side-note to the “Descent”) is correct in writing the former
Hugo, while the latter ought in reality to be Flammevile instead of Camme-
vile.

2 William de Percy, de Kildall, 26 Henr. ΙΙΙ. (124ὲ) is named in the
Yorkshire Pipe Roll. His seal, c. 1265, is in Harl. MSS. 1985, p. 287, with
the five fusils. By deed without date he “ released to Roger Bagott and his
heires all the clame and. demaund he had or might have against the said
Roger for sewte to his mill at Crathorne, etc.'’ He “held in Cleveland
three knights fees, viz. in Kildale, Crathorne, Barwicke and Thormanby, one
knights fee ς in Ormesbie, Lasingbie and Normanbie, one knights fee3 and
in Upsall, Nunthorpe and Aresome, one knights fee.” He “dyed seisde
of ye Mannors of Crathorne, Ormesbie‚ Kildale, Kilnewicke‚ Deplebridge‚
and CaldcoteS, Α0 13 Edw. 1. (1285) ut patet per Inquisitionem.” He lived
to be a very old man, and an “ Inquisitio super statum Willelmi de Percy de
Kyldale'’ was made in the year in which he died, the result of which was
this 2—“Videtur eis (juratoribus) quod idem Willelmus est omnino impotens
sui et virium sui corporis, atque carens ratione et sensu sanae memoriae et
intellectus‚''—(Cal. Gen. i. 359; quoted in Kirkby’s Inquest, pp. 135, 136.)

³ Arnaldus de Percy, by a deed dated 1305, gives to John de Mennell,
son of Nicholas de MeneU, and to Katherine his wife, and their heirs, five
bovates in Kifflale, which he had bought of his brother William de Percy,
besides a variety of other lands and tenements, and rents, in Kildale. In
1308 he gave the Manor of Kildale to his son John in tail; and in 1315} he

besides giving copy of one or more of these deeds, gives also Christiana as
