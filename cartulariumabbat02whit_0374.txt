't'lO OARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WH1TEBY.

Eo vero tempore [1150-1160] praefati monachi nostri [de

form of a direct historical utterance by the Melsa Chronicler, while such a
conclusion is abundantly confirmed by the language of the Continuator of
Symeon. Speaking of the restorers of monkish religion in the north, he
says 2--“ Horum nomina fuerunt: Prior eorum aetate et moribus erat
Aldwinus, secundus Ealfwinus, tertius Rinfridus. Ex his tribus tria in
regione Northymbrorum instaurata sunt monasteria. Unum Dunelmi, . . .
aliud Eboraci in honorem Dei genitricis Mariae, . . . tertium autem in loco
qui quondam streneshald, . . . nunc Witebi appellatur.'' A third con-
sideration originates in the character of the narrative purporting to be that
of Stephen of Whitby, or in the characteristics of the writer himself, who-
ever he may have been. Stephen is represented as having been, by the
universal suffrages of the Whitby fraternity, with Reinfrid at their head,
and backed by the urgent representations of the King and the two Arch-
bishops, compelled, however reluctantly, to assume the office and honours of
Abbot. Then he is advanced to be consecrated Abbot 01 Lastingham also
(ejusdem quoque loci Abbas consecrarer). Then he has interviews with the
King and other great men. In other words, Stephen is exalted—or, sup-
posing him to be the writer, exalts himself—with loud blasts of the trumpet
vigorously blown, and blown moreover with no uncertain sound. It was
scarcely to be expected that such a writer, if Stephen were, in point of
fact, merely one, even though he were the principal one, of a deputed body
of monks whose mission it was “inchoare Monasterium Β. Mariae‚” could
permit himself to descend to the sober prose of the true narration. This
would have been to acknowledge subordination, where his object was to
claim the fullest supremacy. Of course if the narrative had been more
probable in itself, had involved no contradictions and inconsistencies, had
been more reconcileable with certain facts and documents of undoubted
authenticity, there would have been less reason to question or doubt its
veracity in matters of mainly persona] detail. But being what it is, we
have not far to seek for a motive quite sufficiently powerful to cause its
author to ignore any such fact as that alleged by the Melsa writer. The
encomiast of the great first Abbot of the famous Abbey of S. Mary could not
permit himself to describe him as holding a subordinate position in the less
eminent House of Whitby, and as merely the delegate of his monastic
superior in the steps that were taken to initiate what eventually became the
great and magnificent Abbey of York. Assuming then that the Melsa
Chronicler was, in the plain unvarnished statement in the text, alleging a
mere historical circumstance, familiarly remembered in his Convent from
its association with the personal history of the first Abbot of his Convent,
and certainly, as connected with the fact of his having become the said first
Abbot, the most prominent circumstance in his persona] history, we have
at once a sensible glow of light thrown upon the obscure episode, not so
much of Stephen’s connection with Whitby, as of the severance of that con-
nection, and as to both its motive and its manner. From independent con-
siderations we have reason to regard him as “a man of mark,'' a man
