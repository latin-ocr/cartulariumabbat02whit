it. No clew even 10 what may possibly have become of it
seems to be obtainable‚'' and in a note it is added that some
notice of “the conclusions arrived at by the editor as 10 1116 other
possible or supposed copies ''-—that is over and above the
Strickland and Museum copies—“ assumed to have been avail-
able by Dodsworth or the writers he copies from, will also be '²
taken.

It is a noteworthy fact that throughout the Dodsworth col—
lections only two documents 616 by him characterised as “ cartae
adhuc ineditae‚'’ one of th‘em being that which is printed above
as No. 57 6-—being really a “ carta inedita''—the other that
printed as No. 57, with the addition of the names of a few
more witnesses‚ namely “ Gileberto de Percy, Gaufrido Aveline,
VVillelmo de Cumberlande, Roberto de Tybatorp‚ Ricardo de
111011611161, 61 Ricardo Gupil.'⁷ It is further noteworthy that
while references in the form ‘¹ Fol. 23,'' or «f. 136b‚'' are numerous,
and others, in the form “ K. 30¹³? “ K. 34‚'' etc„ scarcely less sc,
the copy found at p. 126¹> of vol. 159 is thus noted at the side:
“ huc usque e collectionibus Ri Gascoigne e lib. de Whyteby.’'1
But the references distinguished by the K are all equally to
Gascoigne's collections, as those without any distinctive letter
or character are to the Strickland copy. And yet further it is
quite apparent that while the undistinctive references always
denote the Strickland copy and nothing beyond, Gascoigue's
references are found from time to time to include extracts from
the Museum copy as well as from the Strickland. But in 110
0656 have references to other sources of information been met
with, excepting of course the “libri de Whitby,'' formerly in
the possession of the Cholmleys, and available up to Gascoigne's
time.

To put this in another form 1—No trace whatever remains‚
save 111 Τ6111161’5 Νο11116, of the existence of the Earl of Kent's
copy, of the being of such a book. It is not intended by this
remark 10 throw discredit 011 Τ6111161’5 accuracy3 but only to
note the fact that, so far as the evidence goes, it was not avail-
able either to Gascoigne‚ or to Dodsworth‚ or to the very many
and various sources on which Dodsworth so constantly and
avowedly dreW. That there must have been other sources is
