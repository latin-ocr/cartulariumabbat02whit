bet cottarius habens vaccam in dicta villa aedificabit, vel aedificare faciet,
unam rudam de ‘le Fauld' pro qualibet vacca. Et tenentes pro tempore
respondebunt pro habitatoribus croftcrum in hiis quae ad agriculturam
spectant, et de bona proprietate servanda cum animalibus suis ad ingrass-
andam terram, et alia quae ad vicinitatem pertineant.⁷’ Now, while all of
this extract is of interest as connected with similar entries in the present
Chartuhry, special interest appears to attach itself to the custom 0r service
required from every cottar owning a cow, and for the due performance of
which by him the tenants of the Bishopric were responsible, namely‚ the
rearing, or causing to be reared, of one rood of what was called ‘⁶ The Fol‹1.⁷’
As in the case of the Horngarth, so here, a fence, hedge, barrier, forming an
enclosure, had to be made, and made by the joint labour of the cow-owning
cottam, under the control of the Bishopric tenants, The fine paid on
entrance, and the rate of assessment, were both so considerable that we are
assured the Church property in question was also considerable at Fettirneyr,
and it should be noted that every cottar possessing a cow throughout the
vill is bound to the service. The fence or barrier then (which might have
been of sod or earth, or more massive still, from the word (cedificare) em-
ployed) must have been of considerable dimensions. Nor was there any
correspondence between “le fauld'’ and our English “pinfold,'' as will be
apparent from the following from J amieson, Scottislt Dictionary, extracted from
the Ayricultzwal Survey of Αόενάθρηεῆῑνθ, under the word FAULDS :—“ That
part of the farm called ‘outfield⁷ is divided into two unequal portions, the
smallest‚ usually about one-third, is called ‘ folds,' provincially faulds, the
other and larger portion being denominated faugyhs. The ‘sold' usually
consists of ten divisions, one of which each year is brought into tillage from
grass. With this intent it is surrozmded with α wall qf sod for the last year
it is to remain in grass, which forms a temporary enclosure that is employed
as a pen for confining cattle during the night-time, and for two or three hours
each day at noon.'' That the custom here described is a survival from the
old service mentioned in the extract from the Aberdeen Register given above
can hardly be doubtful. In the old days “le fauld '' had to be made for the
benefit of the Bishop or See by the hands of the united cow-owning cottars
