δὀὐῑιίανὶς, some kind of foot-covering or stocking. In the Treasury of st.
Paul’s, A.D. 1295, there were—“sandalia de rubro sameto, cum caligis
brendatis: . . . Sotulares sunt brendatae ad modum crucis.⁷'*—(Dugdale’s
H istm-y of St. Paul’s, p. 315.) “ Soteclar, pro socco. Sotzclaris, genus calcea-
menti—Voss. Vide Subtalare.'’ Under Subtalaris, the meaning given is
“pedum tegmen.’'—(Glossarium‚ drawn from Vossius, Dufresne, etc.)

“ De sotularibus. Hic quoque Sotulares corrigiatos de cute quam vulgus
Bazcm appellat, commutavit, tum ad divinum officium expeditius properarent,
nec unus alium in processionibus intricatum illaquearet, tum propter mun-
ditiam et honestatem fratrum, quos decet manus (et maxime circa altare)
habere mundissimas: priore tamen rotunditate anteriore et per totum
amplitudine, ad indicium pristinae humilitatis, remanente—(Mate Paris,

Abbot Guarinus.)

NOTE ΤΟ No. DCVI. (p. 654, vol. ii.)

It may be reinarked in connection with the Litora Qucestns, printed as
No. 606, that a fact of some little interest touching the still existing remains
of the Abbey Church of Whitby is therein brought out—namely, the date
at which a certain portion of the fabric was in process of construction. It
has already been noted that, in the main, the erection of the earlier part of
the said Ohurch, as it stands, was contemporaneous with the presidency
of Abbot Roger. Further, it is clear that the great building effort then
instituted was not relaxed until, after a period of perhaps twenty-five or
thirty years, the choir‚ the tower (or the main part of it), the transepts, and
three bays to the west of the tower had been completed. Then the effort
could be no longer continued. Whether the available resources failed, or
the existing funds had been overdrawn‚ cannot be told, but nothing more,
judging from the architecture only, appears to have been done in the way
of adding to the extent of the nave for the greater part of a century, when
two bays more were built on to the buttress to the tower formed by the
three already erected. From the style of these additional bays it is at once
apparent that the work belongs to the earlier part of the fourteenth century,
and the date of the Libera Quaestus under notice settles the question as to
the precise time at which the work was going on ; while the document which
follows next (No. 607) limits the time before which it had come to an end.
