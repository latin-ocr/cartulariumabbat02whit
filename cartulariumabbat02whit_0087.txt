1 To complete the sense some such phrase as “le premiere achate‚⁷'
employed just below, 16 needed.

2 This might read meses, but is probably as 111 the text, and the old
French 71166, from mettre, may mean either the things deposited 101· 6616
in the open market, or possibly, with 6 more limited sense, things edible so
deposited.

3 The roadstead, a term still in use, and well defined.

4 The Acredike, which appears to have had its local habitation in 66011 of
the townships just named, is mentioned again below (No. 474), and again in
connection with the right of common in it. But no positive clue is afforded
as 10 what it was. A possible solution has presented itself, and in connec-
tion with it it may be observed that Charlton's remark, at p. 227, is—“ From
the rolls that are yet preserved relating to this trial (John of Tocotes v. The
Oonvent) we learn that the bounders of Whitby Strand were originally 661
out by Lady Hilda, about the year 660, and that on the east side thereos
she made certain dykes and ditches, which at the time of this trial still 0011-
tinued to be known by the name of Sc. H ilda’s Dykes; though all these
dykes have now lost that name, and are most of them gone to decay, that
only excepted which is called Greemlylcc.” Probably the dikes here adverted
to are—certainly the last named is—much older than Hilda's time, and
massive dikes do not tend much to go to decay, however much they may
become worn away by the plough, or otherwise be removed intentionally, 01·
perhaps degraded as to height by the lapse of long spaces. But there can be
no foundation for the idea that the Acredike named in the text was in any
sense a boundary as regards Whitby Strand. It will be observed moreover
that it is situate in the chaumpes or campi of the townships of Stakesby,
Newholm, Larpool, Whitby-lathes, and Lathegarth. As Stakesby and
Newholm are on the west side of the Esk, and the other three places
named on the east side, one can scarcely think that it can have been
