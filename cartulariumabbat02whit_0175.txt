CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 513

in Conventus praesentia recitetur: nec, nisi in eorum praesentia
vel sanioris partis eorundem, aliquotiens sigilletur.

Quotiens aliqua praecipua agenda sunt in Monasterio, con—
vocet Abbas omnem congregationem, et dicat ipse unde agitur,
et audiens concilium fratrum tractet apud se, et utilius judi-
cium faciat.

DLXXI.

(184) Noverint univ. per praesentes quod nos, Abbas et
Conv. Monasterii de Whitehy, conc. et dimisimus Roberto de
Erusl de Prestona juxta Atonam in Pikerynglith, et Nicholao
del Werk de Ebor., conjunctim et divisim, pro quadam summa
pecuniae nobis prae manibus data, omnes firmas nostras vocatas
lourghmales‚2 tolnetos‚ custumas, tam per mare quam per ter-
ram, et tallagium3 et omnes exitus et commoditates de villa

¹ There was a noticeable branch of the Brus family settled in or near
Pickering, and a cross—legged effigy, said to be of sir William de Brus, exists
in Pickering Church. An engraving of this is given by Ord (H ist. of 010110-
land, p. 199), and also a short notice of the same, from the pen of the late
W. Downing Bruce (in a note at p. 253), which is scarcely to be depended
upon as authentic. Dodsworth, vol. lxxi. f. 29, gives a charter of Roger de
Mowbray to Master W. 10 Bruys of Pickering‚ 3 Edw. L, relative to a suit
of court at Thirsk3 and again, vol. lx. ε “Esch. 8 Edw. ΙΙΙ. 111. 31. Ebor.
Willelmus Bruys de Pickering posset dare v messuagia, i toftum, iii bovatas
t’rae et ix solidatas redditus in Pikering, Midleton, et Knultorp cuidam

capellano . . . ut in ecclesia parochiali de Pikering singulis diebus cele-
bretur pro animabus Magistri Will. de Pikering et Mag’ri Roberti de
Pikering.”

2 This word is met with again below, towards the close of No. 591Α
under the form ‘burmelL’ In the Inq. p. m. Radulfi Bulmer (taken
41 Edw. HL), who died seised of the Manor of Wilton, it is stated that he
had there a certain rent called “Brennyngmale” yearly, of 4s. 451„ and
another rent called ‘⁶ Turflad,” rendering yearly 4s. Sd„ and a certain other
rent called Brennyngmale‚ yielding 6s. yearly, and a certain rent of 40
hens, yielding 5s. at the Nativity of our Lord, and also another of 190 eggs,
yielding yearly Sd„ payable at Easter. Doubtless the -male in this word
“ Brennyngmale’' is identical with the -male in the present word, and pro-
bably both with -maz'l in “black-mail‚’' which depends upon A.-s. male,
O.N. mala, tributum.

3 “Tailagium‚ Taylag-ium‚ Tauagium, Talliagium, a tax, from willare,
willer, to tax3 specially a talliage, an aid demandable of demesne lands at
the will of the lord.'’—-(Selecc Oliarters .· Glossary.)
