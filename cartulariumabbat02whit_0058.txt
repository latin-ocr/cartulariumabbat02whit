396 OARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

quietum, et integre protestor esse pacatum, exceptioni non
numeratae, non solutae et non traditae mihi pecunize penitus
renunciandoz—Ita scil„ quod neo ego, Petrus, nec heer. mei,
seu executores mei, nec aliquis alius nomine meo, aliquid jus

were examined on behalf οξ the Abbot and Convent of Whitby, viz.,
‚ aged 75 years 3 , aged 60 years 3 Robert Theules of
Whitby, aged 50 years ; John de Lamb of Ryswarp, aged 40 years 3
William, son of John of Risewarp, aged 50 years3 Ralph‚ son οξ Alan of
Sneton, aged 30 years ; Adam of Harewod, in Whitby Strand, aged 30 years;
Astine, a monk at Whithy, of nineteen years’ standing3 William, son of
Osbern of Dunseley, aged 40 years ; and Geoffrey οξ Hakenes‚ aged 48 years,
All these witnesses swore positively that the premises now in dispute were
the fee or freehold οξ Percy, and, as they verily believed, were given by the
first William de Percy and his son Alan to Whitby Abbey ; and that they
had never heard it so much as surmised before that they were at any time
mortgaged to the Abbot and Convent of Whitby by William Fossard or any
other that possessed the manor οξ Mulgrave, seeing the charters and records
in the possession οξ the said Abbot and Convent bore direct witness to the
contrary.

“ A fair copy οξ 311 these depositions and proceedings being made out and
sent to Rome, a Bull was soon after issued by his Holiness, confirming the
possession οξ 311 that part οξ Whitby parish which lies on the west side οξ
the Eske to the Abbot and Convent οξ Whitby, and commanding Lord Peter
de Malo-lacu, and Mr. John οξ Tocotes, to give them no further disturbanee
on that head 3 but to defray all the expenses that had been ineurred by this
law-suit.’'

So far Charlton. No doubt the statement, “came with an armed force‚''
depends upon his misunderstanding οξ the technical phrase “vi ec armis.''
The complaint οξ the Abbot and Convent to the Archbishop is authenticated
by an entry in Archbishop Wickwaine’s Reyister, p. 39, and again at p. 83,
which will be found printed below (No. 593), and from which it appears that
John de Tocotes engages to the Archbishop to restore the abstracted tithes,
but with this reservation ε “ Salva eidem Rectori proprietatis quaestione ad
decimas antedictas.¹’ But there is no note of any threat οξ deposition or
excommunication. Unfortunately, as already observed in a previous note,
“ the rolls relating to this trial‚’' which were extant in Charlton’s time, are
lost, and the story οξ the appeal to the Pope and οξ his Bul] in reply cannot
be verified or disproved by a reference to them, nor yet that οξ the “ trial at
common law by spiritual judges ’' which preceded the appeal. But no doubt
can be thrown upon the statement touching the names and ages οξ the
witnesses who made deposition‚ as the Whitby historian relates. Something
as to the nature οξ the depositions on the other side may be collected from
the depositione in reply by the second list of witnesses given by Charlton
(printed below as No. 592), and no doubt can remain on reading them that the
entire “ process ” was anything but ‘⁴ fictitious.'' Οξ course, it might be open
