¹ It must be noted that the numbers in this Index are those of the old
paging of the book, already noticed as having been at some time taken to
pieces and remacle ; and that the first number in the old paging is χΙχ (17).
I would also remark, that the Index itself is not a very precise or complete
one, and that, besides this, there are omissions or mistakes, the former of
which in the text are indicated by the numbers placed within brackets, as
(50). Moreover, the numbers placed within square brackets, as [lb 21³]
refer to pages which, in the remodelling of the book, were left out or lost.
Where a number is given without either a or b attached to it, it indicates
that both sides of the leaf noted are occupied with the deed in question.
