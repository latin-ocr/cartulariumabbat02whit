pasturam in bosco qui dicitur Le Ker,1 et in plano ejusdem bosci,
et in campis et pratis pertinentibus grangiae de Stakesby‚
Soureby‚2 et de Risewarpe, infra praed. divisas. Et si ita contingat
quod aliqua averia dicti Willelini‚ vel haer. suorum, vel eorum
hominum, in dictis pratis vel campis de Stakesby, Soureby, et
Risewarp, vel averia Abbatis in campis vel pasturis de Aselby,
extra dampnum, sine custodia facta, per escapium invenientur,
sine dampno dictorum averiorum rechaciantur, et si dampna
inventa fuerint, per sacramentum custodum dictorum averiorum
emendetur dampnum. Et si custodes jurare noluerint, per
sacramentum inventorum dictorum averiorum in dicto dampno
capientur emendae. Pro 1166 61116111 recognitione, concessione,
relaxatione, et qu, clamatione concessit Abbas et Conv. eidem
Wfflelmo et haer„ vel suis assign„ et eorum hominibus de
Aselby, communam pasturae omnibus et omnimodis averiis suis,
sine munere, in locis qui dicuntur Lahiscot3 et Neuhamdale,

being most likely a litera] translation of what is now the dialect word,
snubbinq, sneapiny, snibbingy. O. N. snubba, Dan. snubbe‚ both mean to cut
short, to lop or trim ; Clevel. snape or sncap has the same signification,
while snz'b is 6 word applied. 10 1116 removal of the “tops and tails'' of goose-
berries3 and trees, 616., 6111 back by wind, frost, or the pruning-knife, are
said to be snubbed, all these forms representing also the sense implied in
culpare. But note also Fr. couper, O. Fr. σοφεν, 130 6111.

1 See note 2 to No. 446, supra.

2 See note 3 10 No. 446, supra. Notwithstanding Chariton’s positive
identification of this place, it has never appeared to be quite satisfactory. At
p. 398 it will be seen that it is mentioned, as here, in connection with “Le
Ker,'' and with Aselby‚ Baldeby, Stakesby—all of them places on the west
side of the Esk. Young, whom it is safer to follow than Chariton, also iden-
tifies Sourebi as the latter does (p. 889), but without alleging any authority.
The Domesday connection of Sourebi with Prestebi in the mention made of
the Abbot of York’s interest in these rolls may'seem to indicate a relative
mutual vicinity, but apart from any distinct evidence to the fact, it cannot
go for much. Almost clearly it lay somewhere not far out of the line be-
tween the 06115 and Baldby Fields.

3 This is clearly the locality indicated by the name Laghscog, Lagh’scogh',
at pp. 390, 398, and there is scarcely a doubt that it lies in the vicinity of
what 15 here named Newhamdale—the valley through which N ewham-beck
flows, necessarily. It is quite possible that the modern name Ewecot is a
corrupted survival of Lahiscot.
