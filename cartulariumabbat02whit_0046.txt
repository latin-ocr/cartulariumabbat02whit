1 Ricardus de Percy Ι. (10 Dunseley died before 1148, and was succeeded
by his son William, who has grant 01 Dunsley from Abbot Benedict as fully
and freely as his father had held it (No. 265). This William (10 Percy de
Dunsley in ΝΟ. 74 entreats his heir—‘² precor haeredem meum, sicut meus
est filius ’'——to see to the fulfilment of his intentions expressed in the charter,
and among the witnesses to it are named “ Bartolomens 01 Hugo haeredes,‘'
together with the donor’s mother, Atheliza, and his sisters Celestris and
Christina. But it 15 1101 certain that either Bartholomew or Hugo was the
‘⁴ heir” adjured in the body of the deed. Now there was a Richard de
Percy de Dunsley living within the first quarter of the thirteenth century,
as 15 apparent from No. 254, (lating between 1214 and 1220. Again, in
No. 181 William de Percy de Dunsley 15 named among the witnesses, ancl 15
therefore contemporary with Abbot Roger (1223-1244). Then again we
have a Riehard de Percy (10 Dunseley, presumably a contemporary with
Gawayn de Thweng‚ Rector 01 Kirkleatham (who executecl deeds as early
as 1280 [Harl. Μ55. 1985, p. 269], and as late as 1326 [see next deed, No.
436, and also note to No. 14, vol. 1. p. 19]). He 15, most likely, identical
with the Richard de Percy named among the witnesses to No. 22, a deed
dated in 1270 ; while, in reference to the above presumption, it is to be
remarked. that among the witnesses to the deed. by John Hersand (printed in
the note to No. 14, just cited) is a Robert, son of WilIiam de Percy, neces-
sarily “de Dunsley³³ from the tenor of the deed. Probably, therefore,
assuming Richard. de Percy of 1270 and later, to be a son of William de
Percy of Abbot Roger’s time, this Robert last named is a brother of the
said Richarcl's. We have then a William (10 Percy de Dunsley witness to
No. 356, a deed dated in 1305. In No. 439, dated 1308, and again in No. 437,
dated 1326, Symon de Percy filius Will. (10 Percy de Dunseley (or Donsle)—
obviously the Will. de Percy last named, living in 1305—quitclaims to
Whitby rights aud lands in Eskedale, Dunsley, etc„ and finally, in No. 308
