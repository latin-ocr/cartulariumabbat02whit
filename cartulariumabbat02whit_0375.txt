“originally of worldly position and influence,'’ and, besides that, with a
developed capacity for the rule of a monastic institution (see p. lxxi). It is
further very far indeed from unlikely that he did aspire to succeed to the
Priorate on the untimely decease of Reinfrid, and that he would be dis-
appointed by the natural, not to say inevitable‚ preference of a member of
the Founder’s house to himself. If it were so, it would be a strong
additional reason for his selection as the head of the body of monks who
were deputed to commence and organise the monastic settlement “in
honorem B. Mariae⁷’ at York3 and if it were not so, still his recognised
fitness and capacity, and from both points of view—the Secular and the
Religious-might and would be amply sufficient to induce his appointment
as their leader and superior. Possibly even some slight suggestion of a
reason for the fact involved in “the perplexing entry in Domesday”
(p. lxxi.) may also be derived from the same or similar considerations. As
deputed head of such an emigrating body of monks an arrangement—quite
possibly intended to be, as the event proved it to be, a temporary arrange-
ment—as to Prestebi and Sourebi might be made, to which William de
Perci and his brother, Sei-lo, the new Prior, were consenting parties, as well
as Stephen himself. No. 555 establishes the fact that Serlo de Perci had
become Prior by or before 1087 (as Nos. 27 and 579 do that he was still
Prior up to, presumably, about 1095). It was shortly before the demise of
William the Conqueror that Earl Alan of Bretagne is represented as grant-
ing to Stephen and his followers the newly-constructed church of S. Olave‚
and Stephen as availing himself of the grant—in his own terms, yielding to
the sweet persuasions (dulciter persuasit) of the grantor. And then—
“post non multum vero tempus ”—William the Conqueror dies, William
Rufus succeeds, and within the first year of his reign the foundation of the
actual St. Mary's becomes an accomplished fact. This singular coincidence
in point of time between Serlo's accession to the Priorate and William de
Perci’s consequent enlarged endowment of the Whitby House (fully con-
firmed by the Conqueror's second charter), and Stephen's entrance upon his
work at S. Olave’s, with its consummation in the transactions of the follow-
ing year, is surely worthy of distinct attention. So that on the whole it
may well seem that the statement from the Chronica de Melsa commented
upon in this note is one of singular interest and importance in endeavouring
to delineate the early history of the monastery of Whitby. Another con-
sideration arising, not unnaturally, out of a remark made above—to the
effect that it would be idle to suppose Symeon of Durham meant to imply
that the monks in a body left Whitby, so that the monastery there was
entirely forsaken—may here not inaptly be mentioned. At p. lxxxvi. the
possibility, or more, of some temporary check or checks to the prosperity of
the renascent monastery, such as to “ compel a temporary retreat to the
Hackness cell,'' is glanced at. There is no historica] doubt that such a
retreat did take place, and that it took place while the Community was pre-
sided over by Serlo. Tanner and Dodsworth both note “an agreement
