CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 701

2. William de Percy:1 m. Johanna.2 . . .

the Christian name of his wife, and also notes that ‘⁶ Hughe Lisster gave to
Sir Arnald Percy, sonne of Sir William Percy, certene lands in Kildale,
abuttinge uppon Skitterigge, by dede without date.'' These lands also were
among those conveyed to John de Mennell, and Katherine his wife, and
from the magnitude of the grant and the provisions of the conveyance—the
whole gift was ultimately to return to Arnald de Percy and his heirs in
default of lawful issue to the said John and Katharine-—it is scarcely pos-
sible to avoid the conclusion that the said Katharine was a very near relative
of the grantor’s‚ and most likely his daughter. Sir Arnold de Percy appears
as a man of wide possessione and much importance in a variety of instances,
and his Inq. p. m. is dated in 17 Edw. 11. (1323).

¹ “The said Sir W. Percye'' (son of Walter, that is) “ gave to his sonne
William Percy all his manor of Kildale, and after his decease then to
William Percy, sonne of Sir Arnolde Percy, and to ΥΘ heires of his body, and
for want of such ysseue then to the next brother of the said William sonne
of Arnold, by dede without date.'’ This deed, the date of which is fixed by
the inquisition above named, and another by which the same donor gave to
the same donee the manor of Crathorne, are both pronounced by the jura-
tores under the inquest concerning his condition, to have been executed
when he was “non compos mentis suae, nec sanae memoriae, etc.'' This
William de Percy died in Wales 23 Edw. Ι. (129323), as appears from an
Inq. p. m. held that same year. He had held Ormsby by charter of his
father confirmed by his brother Arnold 3 held Kildale cf the heir of Marma-
duke de Thweng, rendering all foreign services to his father William, and
after his death to Arnold de Percy, son and heir of William his father.

2 In No. 464 “ D’nus Willelmus de Percy, filius Will. de Percy de Kildale,
et J ohanna uxor ejus‚'’ quitclaim to Whitby all their right and claim in and
to the advowson of the chapel of Sneton, with all its appurtenances. But
no information is given as to who the said J ohanna was, nor as to the means
by which the said advowson came into the possession of one of the Kildale
Percys. All that can be said on the subject is that it was in the hands of
the Arundel family; that J ohanna ArundeL the last descendant in the
direct line, and heiress, was twice married, if not three times—first to Roger
de Baius, possibly to Hugo de Alta Villa (see N o. 459, and also No. 225 and
note 1, p. 184), and certainly to Richard Vertdos (see No. 460) 3 that alike
in her widowhood and eoverture she calls herself J ohanna Arundel (see Nos.
102 and 460); that Agnes Beyus of No. 461 is much more than presumably
daughter of J ohanna by her first husband ; and that the said Agnes was still
lady in possession down to 1252} It is not known who her husband was,
nor how long her son, ΒΥ whatever name he may have been distinguished,
lived, or to whom, on the supposition that he survived his mother, the lord-
ship, his share of the Bayus inheritance, would next descend. But it cer-
tainly should be observed that, from the date last noted, Agnes Beyus was
a contemporary of William de Percy and his wife J ohanna3 that she was
one of at least two female heirs of Johanna Arundel by her first husband
