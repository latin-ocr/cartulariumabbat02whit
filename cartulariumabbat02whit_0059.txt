Haec est finalis concordia facta in curia D’ni Regis apud Salop’,

to supposition that the formal, and (legally) forcible seizure of the tithes,
with the appeal to the Archbishop, and John de Tocotes' formal submission
and equally formal reservation of his legal rights (if he had any), were all
steps in the process of a fiotitious or friendly suit leading up to the intended
Finalis Concordia. But in that case it is diffieult to see the ground of
appeal to the Pope, or of his interference 3 and it is quite clear from the delay
interposed between the Archbishop’s intervention (September 1280) and the
settlement of the fine (April 1282), as well as from the fact of the earlier set

of depositione, that either that step, or an analogous one, had been taken by
the adverse party.

There is yet another assumption, viz., that, equally with the formal seizure '

by John de Tocotes; the appeal to the Archbishop by the Abbot3 the formal
submission with reservation of rights, if any, of Tocotes 3 the reference of the
entire case, with depositions on behalf of the Abbey, reply on the part of the
claimant, and further rebutting depositions on the part of the Abbey, to
Rome 3 together with the sentence of the Papal Court, was only another step
towards the obtaining of the evidence of title aimed at in the Finalis Con-
cordia, and taken because formally or legally necessary. In that way we
have an explanation of the apparent inconsistency between the alleged sen-
tence of the Pope and the apparent fact that the Abbey, after all, paid the
expenses, and not Peter de Mauley and John de Tocotes. For, unquestion-
ably, either or both of these individuals would be put to heavy expenses for
what, on the assumption, would be of no benefit to themselves, or to either of
them, but would be a benefit to the Abbey. Still, 1000 marks was a strangely
heavy sum to pay even for a benefit very considerably greater than any that
could arise from a mere formal establishment of the right of ownership by
the Abbey of the specified mauors, and in the face of all the facts—the gift
by Willian] de Percy and his son Alan ; the specification of the boundaries
involved in their charters, and in those of their suecessors ; the rights of owner-
ship exercised by the Abbey through long periods over the disputed property,
as (to specify but one instance) in the case of the entire manor of Dunsley;
and the like-it seems altogether inexplicable. Could the payment have been
a mere nomina] one? Apparently it amounted to much more than the
entire annual income of the Abbey, especially at that date of its existence,

and for what really could never have been, it would seem, a matter of
serious question.
