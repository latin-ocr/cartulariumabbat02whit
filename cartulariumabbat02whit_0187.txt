[CARTA FUNDATIONIS HEREMiromr DE Murmur}

Omm‘bus Sanctae Matris Ecclesiae filiis, tam praesentibus
quam futuris, videntibus vel audientibus has litteras, et dominis
et haeredibus suis, Willehnus de Perci, filius Ricardi de Perci
de Dunesley‚ salutem in Domino. Notum sit universitati vestrae
me, in libera potestate mea, fecisse quoddam ermitorium in
nemore meo de Dunesle‚2 apud Mulgrif‚ 111 honore Sancti Jacobi
Apostoli, pro voto meo ex[s]olvendo, et in remissionem omnium
peccatorum meorum, et omnium parentum incorum—scilicet
patris et matris, et fratrum, et sororum, et omnium propin-
quorum meorum, et pro anima conjugis meae, et haeredum
meorum, et omnium illorum qui vel terram vel aliquid bonum
dederunt, vel daturi sunt loco 1111, liberum et quietum in per-
petuum de me, et de haer. 111615, ab 611111. servitiis saecularibus, et

¹ See No. 435, and note to it.

² It may be well to remark that the actual hermitage was in Dunslcy,
within the limits of the original Percy see, and 111 that part of it which was
held of the Abbey of Whitby by the founder of the said Hermitage. I note
this because the popular notion, no doubt connecting itself with the so-callcd
“ Hermitage '' in the Mulgrave woods, is that the ancient Hermitage was 011
or near the same site, or in other words, 011 the Mauley side of the stream
dividing the Mauley fee from the Whitby Abbey lands.

3 lt is not possible to verify these local names, or traee the given
boundary.

4 Balk. A ridge of land left between two furrows. A low ridge or bank
serving in times before enclosure to separate the holding of one man from
that of his neighbour. Within the last thirty years a large field was still
left near Staithes divided in this way into many long and narrow slips.
The word in the text is thus of great interest, and especially so 111 the con-
nection with candela in which it stands.
