Τ. Archiep'o, et Alano comiti, et Radulfo PaganeHo, etc.⁷’ printed as No. 555.
On p. 116b follows copy of the Memoria] (No. 1), as far as to “ex dono
Walteri de Argentom‚ et Will. de Percy de Dunesleia, et Aalizae matris suae
habemus duas bov. t’rae in Suth Lofthus '' (see p. 7), with which it
terminates at the bottom of p. 118¹).

1 This heading, with such authentication as is contained in the final
paragraph, is sufficient to commend the document to a place in the present
collection. It will be alike unnecessary and tedicus to note the various
discrepancies between historical facts and its statements, and consequently
only little in the way of annotation is attempted.

² It is true that Alan, son of William de Pemy, died ap. As to ‘Richard
the first Lord Percy' the same genealogical mistake is made as in No. 639,
p. 689. He belongs to Generation ΙΙ. ; and Robert de Percy, who had. a son
John, belongs to Generation 111., being a brother of William de Pei-cy 11.‚ not
a son.

3 Much of what follows seems to be derived from No. 639, even to copy-
ing Mary as the name of William de Percy’s wife, noted as erroneous in the
document copied from. It adds, however, other particulars in some in-
stannes, and especially as regards ‘ William, the fyrst Abbott of Whytbye‚'
who is here said to have ‘ stode Abbote of Whytbye 26 years.’
