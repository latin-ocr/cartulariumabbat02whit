1 Willelmus de Percy, “d. c. et conf. Deo et Eool. S. Mariae de Gysburnia,’'
all his right in the Ohurches of Ormesby and Orathorne, and the mill of
Kaldeeotes, “sieut in cartis Ernulfi de Percy, avi mei, et Ernulfi avunculi
mei continetur.”—-(Gysb. Chart. f. 21512.)

Will. de Percy de Kildale . . . “pro salute animae Agnetis, uxoris meae '’
confirms “ omnem donationem quam Robertus de Brus dedit eis de feodo
Ernulfi de Percy avi mei.''

Will. de Percy, specifically ‘de Kildale,' is then nephew of Ernald de
Percy and grandson of the first Ernald, and necessarily therefore son of
Robert, Ernald’s brother. But there were more children to Robert than
only this William3 for in 16 Henry 11. Adam de Brus (ΙΙ.) “ r. c. de 250
marcis pro haeredibus Roberti (16 Brus quos habet in custodia sua, pro
habenda terra Ernaldi avunculi sui,'' while Ernaldus himself (11 Henr. IL),
“ r. 6. (16 100 mareis pro recto habendo de Ada de Brus‚'⁷ it being clear thus
that he died between 1165 and 1170. Who these heirs were besides William
de Percy is not apparent. A Hugo, nephew of Walter de Percy, son of the
present William, is mentioned in a Gysburne oharter by the former, in which
he confirms his father's gifts. Of course he may have been a nephew on the
mother⁷s 51(16; but it should be remarked that in the Percy Feodary a Hughe
Pereye is put by the side of Will. de Percy of 1197. A William de Percy
junior is also named in the sanie series of charters, who is probably identical
with Willelmus fil. Ernaldi (16 Percy, who is met with twice as a witness,
and. who may have been illegitimate or a priest. There is also a Henry de
Percy named as a witness to the confirmation by William de Percy de
Kildale specially noted above. He may have been a son of Robert's and
brother of the grantor. From a Conventio between this William de Percy
de Kildale and the Canons of Gysburne “in curia Adae (16 Brus facta'' (Gysb.
Chart. s. 21512) it is ascertained that he was still living in 1197 (which 15
its date), William de Percy, junior, also being a witness.
